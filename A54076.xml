            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here have been in theſe latter days many nice and curious inquiries brought upon the Stage, which tend to ſtrife (beſide ſome other that directly lead to ungodlineſs) and therefore may be referred to that <hi>vain Jangling</hi> cenſured by the Apoſtle; as no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to the enlightning of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the reforming the Life, or directing the Practice.</p>
            <p>To theſe appertains not a modeſt inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry concerning the making gain of Loan, Whether, and how far it may be Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? Practice relating thereto being ſo common, and the moſt of Profeſſors one way or other Intereſted therein; a due and right information ſeems very requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, and the juſt ſtating of the Question of no ſmall importance; both extreams
<pb facs="tcp:107146:3"/>being of ill conſequence: the danger on one hand is, leſt by ſetting the bounds too wide, the Floodgates to many unjuſt and unchriſtian practices be drawn up, which of their own accordbreak in too faſt. On the other hand, by a too rigid and ſevere prohibition of Uſury in all its kinds and degrees, be they never ſo moderate, there is danger, leſt the Intereſt of the Nation be prejudiced, the Conſciences of many be wounded, and the Credit of more blaſted. The vindication of either of theſe were enough to juſtifie me in this deſign and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt (whatſoever the ſucceſs be) much more where there is a concurrence of all three.</p>
            <p>The Advantage and Intereſt of this Nation is not a little concerned in the matter of Lending for gain: This way ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thouſands of Pounds come to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Trading and Merchandizing, which would otherwiſe be diverted to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſes, or hoarded up to no uſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon would neceſsarily follow the decay of that which is the ſupport of this Iſland. Lending being on all hands acknowledged neceſſary to the upholding of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, there is little reaſon to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<pb facs="tcp:107146:3"/>this Lending would be ſo conſtant and common, without ſome encouragement to the Lender.</p>
            <p>The Conſcience of Chriſtians, as well as the welfare of the Nation, is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Queſtion of Uſury: the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice whereof having gotten an ill name, and much decried, and conſtantly batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by objections taken from Scripture and Fathers, by Men of Note, Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Learning; and there having been ſo little written by way of vindication in our Engliſh Tongue; I think there is ground enough to fear, that there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers found, no Strangers to the practice, who do it with a doubting Conſcience, as not fully ſatisfied in the Lawfulneſs of the thing practiſed. There are ſome alſo that lay ſcruples in the way of the Giver, as well as Taker of Uſe, condemning both the one and the other.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing where Conſcience is engaged, Credit and Reputation cannot be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; there are many ſober and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Christians, Lending for gain; that deſerve to have their Innocency clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, and Names vindicated from thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:107146:4"/>foul aſperſions that are caſt upon them by ſuch as are contrary-minded, and by none more than by the late Author of the <hi>Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer Caſt:</hi> The which bears in hard upon Mens Credit and Conſciences, charging every one with damnation that takes any thing by way of gain or recompence for Money Lent. A heavy charge indeed, if true; but whether ſo or no, is the deſign of this following Diſcourſe to inquire.</p>
            <p>The handling whereof hath been deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly managed with that plainneſs and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity of Stile and Language that was requiſite to ſuit with the Capacities of thoſe that mostly need ſatisfaction in this Controverſie.</p>
            <p>I have all along called in the help of ſeveral of our modern Learned Writers, both Divines and others: And probably I may incur cenſure for Larding my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with ſo frequent Quotations, but I thought I could do no leſs, to counterbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the oppoſite plea that is uſually taken from numbers and Learning: thereby to make it appear, that the opinion I plead for, is neither ſo ſtrange nor uncouth, as ſome would obtrude upon the Worlds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:
<pb facs="tcp:107146:4"/>And that there is no ſuch cauſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſhamed of owning that Judgment or practice, the which hath been pleaded for by Men of ſuch Renown and Eminency in the Church of God, both for Piety and Learning. It was a Sage Obſervation of the <hi>Roman</hi> Orator, <hi>That it often comes to paſs, that what was generally counted diſgraceful, may intime be found not to be ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now and then made uſe of the teſtimonies of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Seneca,</hi> two of the Learnedſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Moraliſts, to rebate the plea that is made from the Light of Nature: but I have ſought for no help from Monkiſh ſtories, ſuch as that of Frier <hi>Bertoldus,</hi> or <hi>Don Antonio.</hi> Neither ſhall I Court the Patronage of Greatneſs, a Priviledge that lies as open to Error as Truth: but let Truth ſtand upon its own Baſis, and be its own ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: it being every way ſufficient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, provided it obtain liberty for ſelf-defence, and a fair hearing.</p>
            <p>If after all my care to prevent it, any ſhall think or ſay, that I have taken on me the defence of griping Uſury, unchriſtian
<pb facs="tcp:107146:5"/>dealings, or uncharitable practices, the Book it ſelf will prove a ſufficient witneſs againſt all ſuch Calumniations: The main deſign whereof, is not to decreaſe Charity in lenders; but to give check to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of uncharitableneſs in Cenſurers.</p>
            <p>I have alſo made ſome inſpection into <hi>Mr. Bolton's Diſcourſe of Uſury,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Author I Reply upon, is wont to go to ſharpen his Weapons. I have beſides examined ſome paſſages of <hi>Mr. Capel,</hi> in his Book <hi>Of Tentations,</hi> relating to the ſame Subject: And all theſe finiſhed for above a Year ſince, as here repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; ſaving ſome few alterations (moſtly omiſſions) thought good to be made in the last Tranſcribing.</p>
            <p>Concerning the whole, I can ſay; that I have done it in the integrity of my heart; with a true deſire to further the light, comfort and ſatisfaction of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians; the which, if attained by any, in ſome meaſure, Let him give God the Glory, whoſe Right alone it is.</p>

            <p>In condemning things of this or the like Nature, I dare ſay, there's none of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren would ſcruple to joyn with him: but whiles he overdoes it, and under the ſame condemnation brings all others, that receive any thing back above the Loan, or that have but an intention or expectation of gain on that account; it muſt not be thought ſtrange, if all men are not of his mind here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>Let it be conſidered, whether it be not a likely way to ſtrengthen the hands and harden the hearts of griping Uſurers, to joyn with them a great part of this and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations; and among theſe too, many ſober, ſerious, pious, learned perſons: I ſay again, ſuch confuſed writing of things and perſons, as we find in this Treatiſe, is a more likely way to harden Oppreſſors and greedy Cormorants in their unjuſt and rapacious practices, than to convince them, or abate the number of them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>J.</hi> makes choice for the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of his diſcourſe,<note place="margin">p. 7.</note> of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.5. <hi>He
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107146:7"/>that putteth not out his Mony to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury:</hi> from whence he obſerves, <hi>No <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and dying in the Sin of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury can be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> To counterballance his argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from this Text, I ſhall cite Mr. <hi>Dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>'s Commentary on the ſame. <hi>A Sixth fruit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and evidence of faith, is diſpenſing with Commodity, when God by a ſpecial reaſon calleth for ſo doing, albeit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe a man might take reaſonably more gain; many of ſuch ſort of caſes do occur in Merchandize, and in exacting of Rents and Debts, as circumstances may teach, when and where God calleth for moſt moderation: Such was the judicial diſpenſing with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, put upon the</hi> Jews <hi>for looſing the Yoke of a Bought Servant, being a</hi> Jew, <hi>at at the end of ſix years, and quitting of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Lands bought from a</hi> Jew, <hi>at the Year of</hi> Jubilee, <hi>how dear ſoever it coſt the Buyer; and not taking <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury of a</hi> Jew, <hi>wherein the</hi> Jew <hi>was priviledged above men of another Country: for in all theſe three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, it was lawful for the</hi> Jew <hi>to do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with other Country-Men,</hi> viz. <hi>In buying a Servant from a Stranger of another Country, and tranſmitting it to his own Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and taking <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury of a Stranger, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rate which was acknowledged on all hands to ſtand with Equity; which Commodity if an</hi> Iſraelite <hi>did not diſpenſe with toward an</hi> Iſraelite, <hi>it made him ſhort

            <p>Thus far Mr <hi>Dixon,</hi> who underſtands the Law concerning Uſury, with ſeveral others, to be peculiar to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation and Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>To Mr. <hi>J.</hi> perſonating <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 8.</note> I ſhall ſay, unleſs he uſe <hi>David</hi>'s ſling with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s ſpirit, it were better he let it alone; leſt letting flee, as he does, amongſt ſuch a heap and <hi>Conglomeration,</hi> (as he calls them) ſuch a mixt multitude, I mean, as take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, inſtead of <hi>Goliah,</hi> he hit ſome that truly fear God, wounding his little ones, and making ſad thoſe hearts he ought not; and ſo be brought to Confeſſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation with <hi>Job</hi>'s three friends, that ſpake not a right of God, and to the grief of his Servant <hi>Job.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſeveral Names by him mention'd as given to Uſury,<note place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> I ſhall not here concern my ſelf in; there having been, and ſtill is ſuch rigid exaction and bitter oppreſſion in the world, whereto all his Titles and Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologies attending properly belong.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Intereſt</hi> he will not have called;<note place="margin">p. 10.</note> Why not? Seeing Intereſt is <hi>an Overplus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Principal,</hi> the which he confeſſeth the Antient Doctors of the Church call U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury. Let us ſee his reaſon to the contrary. Intereſt with him is lawful, <hi>becauſe properly 'tis damage Money to be paid for the keeping
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107146:8"/>back of a Mans Money.</hi> Mark the Nicety; It is unlawful in his Account for a man to receive from another any thing for the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion and uſe of his Money; but, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> for the ſame Money unduely kept back 'tis lawful to receive damage Money. That is, in other terms, if you lend your Money for a half year only, it is unlawful to take Uſe for the Money ſo lent, whatſoever loſs is by you ſuſtained; but if the perſon to whom the loan is made, keep it beyond the time Covenanted, then you may take (if not Uſe, yet) damage Money for the detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereof. If Intereſt may be paid, why is it not as lawful for me to give for the Improvement I have made of anothers Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as for the loſs he hath ſuſtained by the loan?</p>
            <p>The weakneſs of ſuch reaſoning with the nicety of ſuch diſtinguiſhing, I find ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently laid open by the famous <hi>Grotius;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Annot. <hi>in Luc.</hi> 6.35.</note> 
               <hi>Video à pleriſque,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I perceive</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that moſt of thoſe, who condemn <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, do not diſallow of ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury as doth ariſe from delay, and thereupon grant, that unleſs the loan be returned at the time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I may contract for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury; but what other is this, ſave to affix the Law to words, and not to things? For, if that opinion be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it ſhall be lawful thus to covenant; unleſs you repay within three days, you ſhall give ſo much for delay; if ſo be the mention of thoſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107146:9"/>three days were omitted, the Contract would be unlawful; ſuch are the Subterfuges of words, whereby the ſubtilty of the Schools de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends it ſelf, which when applyed to things, then its vanity appears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Grotius</hi> his Account then, this legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, <hi>paying for delay,</hi> by ſuch as plead againſt all uſe, is but a hard ſhift they are driven to, a playing with words or a meer evaſion.</p>
            <p>I would be ſatisfyed, if Mr. <hi>J.</hi> pleaſe in theſe following Inquiries; 1. Whether it be lawful for one that lends, to <hi>Expect</hi> ſomething for his loan, upon a ſuppoſition of this delay? 2. Whether it was lawful for a Jew lending to his poor Brother, to receive this <hi>Damage-Money?</hi> 3. Whether, if Damage make the gain thereupon taken lawful, one that puts out his Money for a year to his damage, may not as juſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſatisfaction for that years damage ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained, as for what accrues in the years fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, when the time is expired and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment delayed? with what ballances do they weigh, that hold it lawful to receive <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt-money</hi> either upon the Account of <hi>gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing,</hi> or <hi>loſs ſuſtained;</hi> and yet condemn the receiving any profit for a certain ſum lent for ſeveral years; ſeeing it is ſo hard to make an univerſal Diſtinction between the one and the other?</p>
            <p>I attend his motion onward: <hi>Damage-money</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:107146:9"/>(ſaith Mr. <hi>J.</hi>) <hi>is to be paid for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back of a mans money; when it was due</hi> Whereas, ſay I, it was by the Lenders volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary conſent, that the Money was at any time <hi>undue;</hi> being he might have kept it at firſt in his own hand if he pleaſed; and by the like voluntary conſent it might have continued <hi>undue</hi> for a longer ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>I come to the Definitions of Uſury pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by him; ſome whereof place it,<note place="margin">p. 11.</note> in <hi>Exacting</hi> gain, others in the <hi>Compact</hi> or <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> he alſo in the <hi>Expectation;</hi> Though Mr. <hi>J.</hi> frequently boaſts of the numbers ſtanding on his ſide, yet he produceth very few, that go hand in hand with him, in ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it ſo high, <hi>viz.</hi> in the expectation or hope of any gain.</p>
            <p>His own Definition is this, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury is a certain and abſolute gain, compacted for, or expected, and taken for the loan of things, which may be conſumed in the uſe thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know not whether this Definition be to be taken in a compounded or divided ſenſe; I mean, whether this gain, to make it complete Uſury, muſt be both <hi>certain</hi> and <hi>abſolute, compacted for, expected and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> &amp;c. or elſe any one of theſe differences added unto gain, as the <hi>Genus,</hi> may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make it Uſury, provided it be, <hi>for the loan of things, which may be conſumed in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe thereof.</hi> If it muſt be taken in a divided ſenſe (as the disjunctive particle
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107146:10"/>would inforce) then ſome terms are redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and ſuperfluous; but if it be taken in a Conjunctive Senſe, then whatſoever gain ſo taken or expected, is not <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>certain;</hi> but <hi>uncertain</hi> and <hi>conditional</hi> is not Uſury; ſo alſo, when the ſame is <hi>expected,</hi> but not <hi>compacted for.</hi> Beſides, This limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>abſolute and certain</hi> (whatſoever the reſt be) is not ſcriptural; but added ('tis like) on purpoſe to ſalve <hi>Adventuring</hi> from being Uſury; For all the other parts of the Definition agree thereto. So doth his ſecond Definition, which is, <hi>Whatſoever is more then the principal, compacted for, or expected, and taken for the loan of things, which may be conſumed in the uſe thereof.</hi> The like doth that taken from <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> viz. <hi>Whatſoever is more than the Principal is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury;</hi> as alſo that other Definition, which he ſays is generally received, <hi>viz. All that a man takes over and above the Money lent;</hi> Such, I ſay, is gain upon adventure.</p>
            <p>The which being denyed by Mr. <hi>J,</hi> let us examine his Reaſons; <hi>The gain of adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>depends upon the Ships ſafe coming and going.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo doth the gain of loan, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal too, depend on many mens ſingle ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, ability and integrity; or if it did not, there is in the former proportionable gain that anſwers the hazard, in that the adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer takes three times the gain (or more)
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107146:10"/>that the other takes, who lends upon Uſe.</p>
            <p>He adds, <hi>Becauſe the Principal is lost, if the Ship be loſt.</hi> I Reply, ſo the lenders prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal is loſt, if the Debtor break; and ſo too the Adventurers gains be great, if Ship or Bills return.</p>
            <p>He goes on with Explaining the Term of the Definition; <hi>It is gain compacted for; —thus much thou muſt pay me for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply,</hi> He is not ignorant, that ſome lend without ſuch a Compact, the which yet eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape not his cenſure. It ſhall ſuffice here to ſay, that it is the law that bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the ſum to be taken; and ordinarily to take, what the Law (grounded on Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) allows, I ſee not the Injuſtice; for if it be the Law, that diſtinguiſhes propriety, and in ſome caſes, with us of this land, ſtates the price betwixt <hi>buyer</hi> and <hi>ſeller,</hi> why it may not do ſo here in our Caſe, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not. <hi>Or Expected or Intended.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>J.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>This is pleaded from our Saviours Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.35. <hi>And lend hoping or look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for nothing again.</hi> This being the place of Scripture he builds ſo much confidence on, and ſo often quotes to prove their ſtate damnable, that expect any the leaſt gain from Loan: In the ſenſe hereof, if he be miſtaken, (as I doubt not to make it appear that he is) then down totters his Definition, with all the harſh cenſures built thereon.</p>
            <p>For his two Divines here cited by him to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:107146:11"/>ſtrengthen his Interpretation of this Text, I ſhall give him by and by ſeveral others, that put other ſenſes upon the ſame, and theſe more probable.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I ſhall demand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this <hi>intention,</hi> or expectation of gain were Uſury under the Law, a ore theſe words were ſpoken by Chriſt; or was it unlawful under the Law to lend hoping for any thing again, from any hand whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver? if yea, where was the ſame prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? produce the Text: But the contrary can be ſhewn, in that lending to Strangers for gain was allowed; and therefore gain expected, did not univerſally lay open the the expectant to cenſure. But if this be only a Definition of Uſury under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, then he neceſſarily falls in with thoſe which hold, that Chriſt did not only inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, but added to, and perfected the Law by new Counſels.</p>
            <p>He aſſerts, <hi>And taken,</hi> as part of the Definition, yea, enough to make it Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if <hi>Jerom</hi> may be judge, whom he brings in ſaying: <hi>Whatſoever it be that a man tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth above that which he gave or lent, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury or an overplus.</hi> If this be true, it makes againſt Intereſt and a free gift too, (which are yet by Mr. <hi>J.</hi> allowed) for both theſe are taken. We underſtand far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from him, that this <hi>taking</hi> muſt be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly nor indirectly, neither by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107146:11"/>or another, as if it were ſome bribe or Simoniacal Contract.</p>
            <p>He ſuperadds, <hi>for Loan;</hi> for that is the Ingredient that poyfons all. I may then receive a free gift from a rich man, be it Mony, Houſe or Land: but if I expect, or receive any of theſe from him upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Loan, this is the ſin of Uſury.</p>
            <p>But why may not any thing be taken for Loan? <hi>becauſe Loan ought to be gratuitous:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>J.</hi> p. 1.</note> Of a truth this is a free borrowing, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther begging the queſtion, taking that for granted, and uſing it as an argument which is the very thing to be proved. How proves he that taking gain for mony lent is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful? his reaſon is, <hi>becauſe all Loan ought to be free.</hi> How doth he prove that all lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even to men able to make recompenſe ought to be free? that of <hi>Luke</hi> 6.35. will prove no more but that we ought to lend freely to ſome perſons there intended, <hi>viz.</hi> the Poor; ſo ſay moſt Divines that I have met with on this Subject; at preſent I ſhall name but one, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Tho. Taylor:</hi>
               <note place="margin">On <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.12. p. 471.</note> 
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be ready to diſtribute and lend freely to the Poor, looking for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing again; for there is injuſtice as well in withholding that which Gods Word hath made another mans Due, as in purloining his Right from him: Now the Word commanding to give to the Poor according to every ones abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and to lend to the Poor Members of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107146:12"/>Chriſt, if need require, freely; to be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted and ſtrait handed in theſe caſes, is to be unjuſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But if all lending muſt be free, then let this contract paſs under another name, and that ſore is healed. Hear <hi>Ames;</hi>

               <hi>can ſolidly be proved by no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon: Not of thoſe who ſay that lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of its own nature ought to be free; for neither can this be proved; that all lending, how ſoever circumſtantiated, ought to be free; and if this were granted, nothing elſe would thence follow; but that lending, if it be not freely done, paſſeth into ſome other Contract, either named or unnamed; either ſimple or compound.</hi>

               <hi>It cannot be proved by thoſe who alledge, that in ſuch things as are conſumed in uſing, the dominion is not distinguiſhed from the uſe, and therefore nothing can be taken for the uſe, beyond the worth of the thing, or the thing it ſelf: for it is anſwered, the gain is not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved meerly for the uſe of the thing lent, as to its ſubſtance; but as to its worth or fruit, which remains after the ſubſtance is conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſubſiſts often in things which are not conſumed in uſing; as alſo for the office and act of lending, from whence the borrower makes his advantage.</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107146:14"/>are very bitter againſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury: for they had reſpect to that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury which prevailed too much in all Ages againſt Equity, Honeſty, Charity and Faithfulneſs; as</hi> Chryſoſtome <hi>upon</hi> Matthew <hi>ſaid, there was nothing more cruel; nothing more ſhameful than the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his time: but it follows not that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it of all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>But doth not the Adventurers gain go on at the ſame rate? and when the Farmer makes up his Rent for a year, do not nights and Lords days come into account, and alike fill up the time with the reſt? but this reaſoning (as the foregoing) is not his own; he freely borrows, and never tells the World to whom he is beholding.</p>

The laſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Author anſwers alſo this objection:<note place="margin">Ut ſupra p. 802.</note> Obj. <hi>The proper and primary uſe of money is its conſumption, therefore it is unlawful to receive any reward for money lent, which is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury:</hi> Thomas <hi>urgeth this as the primarie argument. — I anſwer,</hi> 1. <hi>The Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is not ſimplie and excluſivelie true, and the proof is inconſequent. The primarie uſe of money is not ſo much its conſumption, as the procuring of ſomething elſe by its conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for by exchange ſomething paſſeth from another to us, and back again ſomething paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from us to another, whence we loſe or part with the right we had to our own, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:107146:20"/>the right to ſome other thing.</hi> 2. <hi>The conſequence is falſe, that is not ſold which is not; but profit is received by that thing which was procured by our money; which often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in ſuch Commodities, which are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe: Neither is it ſimply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, that two recompences be required for two things: one for the Principal, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored; the other for the profit which the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower hath gained by our money; for it is meet that ſome part thereof redound to us. Neither is the ſame twice ſold: for money is lent that it may be repaid, and ſomewhat ought moreover to be reſtored for the gain: for ſeeing our money proves gainful to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, why not alſo to our ſelves? eſpecially if more gain accrue to that other, than to our ſelves.</hi>

            <p>Paſſing by other Interpretations, you ſee how many the text is favourably capable of: and thoſe more probable (ſome if not all) than that Mr <hi>J.</hi> brings from the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> reading.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But let it be ſuppoſed, that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation be the trueſt, viz. <hi>Lend, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for nothing again,</hi> by way of uſe, this may be, and yet not all taking of gaine for loan be here condemned, to this purpoſe I ſhall produce what <hi>Mayer</hi> writes thereon. Now (ſaith <hi>Mayer</hi>) we cannot <hi>be thus kind unleſs we lend our money, or any thing elſe to our Neighbour freely, if we can ſpare it for a time, he having need thereof: but this free lending is not without looking to have
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107146:27"/>the thing lent referred again; but although he to whom we lend be poor and cannot, or a churle and will not, in the like requite us in our need. A man is not hereby bound to lend freely any great ſum to the rich for ſix or twelve months, as the manner is moſt Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of lending or borrowing, but only for ſome ſhort time, that ſo his neceſſity may be ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the lender may have his money again in due time for his maintenance. If other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe one man puts his money into the hands of another for his trading and commerce from year to year, it is not againſt this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to require recompence therefore; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a gain coming in hereby, with all which it is no equity that the borrower ſhould go away with and the lender not have a proportion according to the money lent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This duty then muſt neceſſarily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to the perſons that are fit objects for our charitable or free lending; for all perſons may be branched into three ſorts. 1. The extreamly poor and neceſſitous. 2. Others not ſo poor, but yet of mean condition, and ſomewhat ſtraitned. 3. The rich or wealthier ſort. As to the firſt ranke, <hi>Give to every man that asketh of thee, Ver.</hi> 30. Mr. <hi>J.</hi> Surely will not underſtand this without limitation: it muſt be reſtrained to ſuch as are fit objects of our Almes; otherwiſe there would be no
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:107146:27"/>room for lending; <hi>v.</hi> 36. <hi>Lend, hoping,</hi> &amp;c. this, let it be granted, concerns the ſecond ſort, to whom we are to lend <hi>gratis,</hi> expecting nothing back beſides the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal; yet this hinders not, but that from others, beyond theſe in condition, we may receive ſomewhat back by way of reward for the Loan: for if, <hi>Give to every one,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily hath its reſtrictions; why ſhould not, <hi>Lend, hoping for nothing again,</hi> have its reſtrictions too?</p>
            <p>Saith <hi>Rivet: Of the three ſorts of men which ask of us; as it is not unjuſt if the firſt, who are poor, ask of us, without hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing: ſo again, it would be unjuſt, if they of the ſecond ſort, who may be ſometime able to repay, ſhould ask of us without a purpoſe and promiſe of repaying; for we are not bound to give an Almes to ſuch, but to the former only. In like manner it follows, that it is inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with Charity, if the third ſort of Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners demand of us a loan altogether free, which is due only to the ſecond ſort of poor.</hi>

            <p n="5">5. To advance yet one ſtep further: the things which the ſinners are here ſaid to do, are ſuch as are lawful, and ſome, at leaſt, commendable: only Chriſt's Diſciples are to tranſcend, and not reſt contented with their having done that which Sinners did: <hi>Chriſts Diſciples are to lend freely, without taking any gain for loan,</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>J.</hi> from this Text:) If ſo, it follows thoſe Sinners did lend with an expectation of gain for their loan. I pray mark it; The Sinners were not here brought in as blame-worthy in the things they are ſaid to do: only this was not enough; Chriſtians muſt exceed in righteouſneſs and go beyond them, <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>ſinners are ſaid to love thoſe that loved them:</hi> I truſt it was well done; but they ſhould have loved their Enemies alſo, <hi>v.</hi> 33. <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107146:29"/>did good unto thoſe that did good unto them;</hi> and ſo far it was well done: but they ſhould alſo have done good to the ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as need required, <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>ſinners did lend to them of whom they hoped to receive,</hi> what? <hi>gain for their loan,</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>J.</hi>) And muſt this only be condemned? 'tis to me no doubt, but this was lawful as well as the aforegoing; but Chriſtians muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed them, lending freely to the poor, whence there was little hopes of any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or the like courteſie to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved back. Compare this Text with, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where Chriſtians are required <hi>to do more than others:</hi> There are many things which ſinners do, which may and muſt be done by Saints; but only theſe muſt not reſt in ſo doing, they muſt do ſome ſingular things which others do not: And this is intimated in that repeated Phraſe, <hi>What reward have ye? Zanchy</hi> illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates this place by <hi>Luke</hi> 14.12, &amp;c. <hi>When thou makeſt a Dinner or a Supper, call not thy friends,</hi> &amp;c. 'tis lawful, no queſtion, to invite our Friends and Brethren and rich Neighbours to a Feaſt: but theſe, 'tis like, will anſwer them in the ſame kind, with Feaſt for Feaſt; therefore there is no thank due, but beſides theſe, there muſt be a feeding of the Poor (eſpecially Gods Poor) that cannot recompenſe thee again, but God will.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Reply:</hi> 1. Our Author you ſee, writes <hi>Stilo veteri:</hi> But what then, if the lender agree in partnerſhip with the borrower, and run the hazard of the Principal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to ſhare both in his gains and loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?

            <p>Mr. <hi>J.

               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. I would know, if on this ſcore, any one ſhould come to Mr. <hi>J.</hi> to borrow this 400 pound, would he lend it him free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? or is any other bound to do ſo?

            <p n="2">2. Give me leave to make a ſuppoſition too, ſuppoſe then this purchaſer meets with a friend, that lends him this 400<abbr>l</abbr> for 10<abbr>l</abbr>

It is the Extortion in both, that makes the ſin; without which the kind or terms of the tranſaction would not be guilty, — In the ordinary loan-uſury the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hath yet time to boot for his money; but here the buyer pays down an exceſſive Intereſt without any conſideration, but the ſellers cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty.</hi>

            <p>And <hi>Rivet</hi> from <hi>Junius:</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 285.</note> — <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if it could be proved, That the taking of all Increaſe was abſolutely forbidden to the</hi> Jews, <hi>even in reſpect of a Wealthy Brother; it would not follow now, all yearly Increaſe to be altogether unlawful: for in this Law there might be ſomewhat Ceremonial and Civil mixt, which ſhould not bind other Nations beſides the</hi> Jews; <hi>for the</hi> Jews <hi>might not ſell their Poſſeſſions for ever; but the buyer only did receive the profits unto the year of</hi> Jubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee, <hi>wherein unmoveable goods ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the right owner,</hi> Lev. 25.10, 15. <hi>But if it had been lawful for a</hi> Jew <hi>to take uſe of his Brother, that Law had been rendred uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; for one would never have bought a Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of another; but rather, would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a yearly ſum, without any toil, when he ſhould have known that the Poſſeſſion was to be reſtored to his Neighbour at a certain time. There is another Law of releaſing Debts to a brother every ſeventh year,</hi> Deut. 15.1. <hi>But if it had been lawful to exact
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107146:41"/>that increaſe from a brother, they would have ſo managed their Exactions in the ſix years, that at the time appointed there ſhould be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left to be releaſed to their Brother.

            <p n="5">5. This adminiſters another proof, That this Law was Political, and Uſury not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Law of Nature, beeing they might lend to a Stranger upon Uſury, though not to a Brother.</p>
            <p>Mr <hi>J.</hi> 3. <hi>The very Law of Naure is againſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply;</hi> I grant it, if meant of oppreſſive and biting Uſury, not elſe. Mr. <hi>J.</hi> here miſ reports <hi>Cicero,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cicero de Off. l. 3.</note> as if he had ſaid, <hi>that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury is more againſt Nature than Death:</hi> whereas <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaks not there in ſpecial of Uſury; but of increaſing a Mans Eſtate by damnifying another, which may be the fault of the borrower as well as of the len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;<note place="margin">Rivet p. 281.</note> and I find the words of <hi>Cicero</hi> made uſe of by the contrary minded to ſtreng-then their Opinion: <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith thus; <hi>It is againſt Nature to advance a mans profit by the diſprofit of another.</hi> Again, <hi>The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largment of a mans own eſtate, hurting none,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107146:41"/>is not to be diſpiſed; but wrong is always to be voided: but to detract any thing from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and for one man to advance his profit by the diſprofit of another man, is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature than Death, than Poverty, than Grief, than any other things which can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the body or outward eſtate: for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will not permit, that by the ſpoils of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers we ſhould increaſe our Subſtance, Wealth, Riches: Neither is it only determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Nature,</hi> i. e. <hi>by the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but alſo by Popular Laws, whereby Commonwealths in their ſeveral Cities are ſuſtained, that it may not be lawful for any to hurt another for his own advantage; for this the Laws reſpect, this they deſign, that the Conjunction of Citizens be ſafe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then, the general Rules <hi>Cicero</hi> lays down, concerns both Parties;<note place="margin">De Jure <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 215.</note> and <hi>Grotius</hi> citing them, adds, <hi>So great is the equity of this Saying, that hence the Lawyers define many things without the Preſcript of Laws, always appealing to Equity it ſelf as the moſt evident.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By theſe Rules then, which are fetcht from the heart of Nature, It is unequal and unjuſt for any to grow rich by money borrowed, and the lender not to have the leaſt advantage thereby; but that he ſhould forgo his money to anothers pleaſure and advantage to his own detriment: How then the Law of Nature ſhould be againſt all
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:107146:42"/>gain opon loan; or how the Heathen, yea, all Nation among them, ſhould be ſo quick-ſighted, as to diſcern, that all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of gain for money lent ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the very Law of Nature, ſeems very ſtrange. Let that be weighed we receive from <hi>Grotius</hi> (who was as quick-ſighted in Natures Dictates as moſt others:) <hi>Per rem hactenus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 601.</note> &amp;c. <hi>So far they are obliged in this matter, that they may not become weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier by anothers loſs,</hi> i. e. <hi>That either they perform the Contract, from whence they are willing to receive the profit; or let them part with the profit: — But on the contrary, they cannot be excuſed as free from unjuſtice; who though they diſlike the Compacts, yet keep the profit which they ſhould not have had without theſe Compacts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To one pleading for Uſury, and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the general practice of the World, and the Law of Nature written in the hearts of men:<note place="margin">Append. Of Uſ. p. 296.</note> I find Mr. <hi>Capel</hi> to anſwer him thus: <hi>For the general practice of the World, I do not know, nor can he know what it is;</hi> this may ſerve for an anſwer to his quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of Biſhop <hi>Sands, viz. That all Nations at all times have condemned <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury:</hi> the which aſſertion is eaſily ſpoken, but hard to be proved; yea, ſoon diſproved by the ſeveral Laws that have been made in ſeveral Ages, by Pious Emperors, Kings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the allowance thereof, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107146:42"/>the ſum that might be taken; as <hi>Zanchy</hi> quoted, mentions; and more may be diſcovered in due place. I have read of a Law amongſt the Ancient <hi>Greecians</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> that allowed one in the hundred, therefore called <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nciarie <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to unfold this a little: We may come to underſtand, whence Uſury came ſo generally to be forbidden among the Learned Heathen, both <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans:</hi> If we mark what <hi>Grotius</hi> writes, <hi>viz. That the Laws of the twelve Tables among the</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>were borrowed from the</hi> Grecians, <hi>and theſe borrowed their Laws from the</hi> Hebrews. And by the Laws of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Uſury be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forbidden, it came thence to be incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated into the Laws of other Nations; and whatſoever Laws have ſince by any Chriſtian Princes been made againſt Uſury, it is eaſy to believe they had their ariſe from the ſame fountain.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>J.</hi> 4. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury is forbidden in the Now Teſtament by our Saviour,</hi> Luk. 6.35. <hi>and therefore the Law againſt it cannot be meerly Political.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. <hi>Meerly Political:</hi> None, that I know, ſaith it is, and therefore that term is ill foiſted in: it is commonly ſaid, that the political Laws of God carried a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral equity in them; and it is acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is an Uſury that is againſt Natures Law, as we have often ſaid. If this Law
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107146:43"/>be proved to reach the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, ſo that one <hi>Jew</hi> might not take Uſe of another <hi>Jew,</hi> whatever he were, it ſhall ſuffice to ſay, that it was ſo far political.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.35. hath been already ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken too, and it hath been proved, that all taking of Uſe is here forbidden, neither expreſly nor conſequentially; it being the Intereſt of his poor Diſciples, that Our Lord is here pleading:<note place="margin">Whole Duty of Man. <hi>p. 367.</hi>
               </note> what is written by a Judicious Author, may ſerve for a farther Comment thereon.</p>

               <hi>Sometime a ſeaſonable Loan may do as well as a gift, and that may be in the power ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of thoſe that are able to give but little: but when we</hi> thus lend on Charity, <hi>we muſt lend freely without <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, and alſo with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that if he ſhould prove unable to pay, we will forgive ſo much of the Principal, as his needs require, and our abilities will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>J. Here <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurers make two Replys.</hi> 1. <hi>That <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury is not named by Chriſt, — nor any where in the New Teſtament.</hi> 1. <hi>Anſ. True, nor is Sodomie committed with a Beaſt named in the N. Teſtament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply:</hi> The reaſon is not the ſame: this latter being a ſin of rarer practice, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in it a greater abhorrency to nature, it was thought ſufficient, that in the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtanding Law it was ſeverely prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; none of the Prophets that came after,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:107146:43"/>making any mention thereof. The very naming of ſome ſins (ſuch as this) ſtriking a horror into the hearers minds, no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter if their names, together with their practice, were quite forgotten. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaking of Fornication and Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (the ſame very applicable here) ſays, <hi>let it not be once named amongſt you as beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Saints.</hi>

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:107146:44"/> 1. <hi>Reply:</hi> Theſe proofs come far ſhort of the Aſſertions: If theſe Emperors made Laws againſt Uſury; then, 'tis like, it was grown common, and fell under Publick Notice; and as ſoon as Laws are made, practices of that nature are not quite ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: ſuppoſe Publick Laws Enacted in our Land againſt Drunkenneſs and Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; would that ſave Mr. <hi>J.</hi> the labour from Preaching down thoſe Vices?

I think not; the <hi>Romans</hi> leaving the Conquered Nations moſtly to enjoy their own Laws.<note place="margin">De Jure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 556.</note> 
               <hi>Auguſtus</hi> (as <hi>Grotius</hi> hath it from <hi>Philo</hi> in his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage to <hi>Caius</hi>) <hi>thought the cuſtody of the Laws proper to each Nation, belonged no leſs to his care, than thoſe of the</hi> Romans.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If this were granted too, that the Imperial Laws were impoſed on <hi>Judea,</hi> and Uſury thereby quite Suppreſt, does he not remember that Our Lord in the Goſpel deſigned Rules, not only for the preſent; but alſo for after-times of his Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But it is a ſtrange preſumption to think, that all Uſury was indeed quite ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt by theſe Laws; and he leaping from <hi>Claudius</hi> to <hi>Vespaſian,</hi> gives cauſe of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, that the inter-mediate Emperors were not ſo ſevere againſt it, conſidering withal, that <hi>Seneca</hi> living in that Interval, was (by his own quotation) a notable U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107146:44"/>who was contemporary with <hi>Paul</hi> and other Apoſtles: And being it was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by ſo great a Moraliſt as <hi>Seneca,</hi> it ſets me a wondring how they ſhould have ſo great a Charity for <hi>Tiberius,</hi> (a man made up of craft and cruelty) as to believe he ſhould exceed the greateſt Preſician for Morality in his time, (not to mention ſome of the ableſt and pureſt Chriſtians of theſe latter days;) as alſo that the Law by him made againſt Uſury was in real deteſtation of Oppreſſion; and not rather, a cunning inſinuation to ingratiate himſelf with the Multitude; and withal, a politick fetch to ſuppreſs all the Petty Uſurers, that he might have vent for his money, and mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polize the Trade to himſelf; pretending free lending, but intending to make his Market by the forſeiture of the double Bonds; which whoſoever ſhould do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, would probably be a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gainer than any other Uſurer, that keeps within the bounds of the Law could be.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And upon the whole, their caſe ſeems wide from ours, Uſury then, after the Laws Enacted againſt it, becoming a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of a Civil Law, moderate Uſury with us, not ſo.</p>

               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. This Proof overthrows it ſelf; for it by <hi>Stranger</hi> (to whom they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to lend on Uſury, as well as to a Brother) we are to underſtand a Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite, or one turned to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion; then it follows neceſſarily, that by <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> to whom they were to lend upon Uſe, we muſt underſtand all other Strangers, not ſo Proſelited, of what Nation ſoever, and not the <hi>Canaanite</hi> only.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Text will clear it ſelf; for there <hi>Brother</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>Stranger:</hi> The <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi> was not their Brother, therefore a Stranger, and conſequently, one to whom they might lend upon Uſury; and ſo len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſuch end is not againſt the Law of Nature. The <hi>Jews</hi> might not oppreſs a Stranger, that is frequently forbidden them; but yet they might lend to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers upon Uſury, and therefore all Uſury
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107146:46"/>is not Oppreſſion, nor againſt the Law of Nature.</p>

               <hi>The Scripture</hi> (ſaith Learned <hi>Ames</hi>) <hi>ſeems to indicate ſome <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury to be lawful in it ſelf,</hi>

               <hi>neither is the Contract for gain upon Loan, ſinful in it ſelf, or againſt the Law: otherwiſe, this had not been at all allowed or granted; the which God indeed prohibited the</hi> Jews <hi>amongſt themſelves, not with Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: for what is in it ſelf a ſin, is every where ſuch, and can no where be counted law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or be approved: no not with the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile. <hi>The Laws are ſuch, for here are two to be conſidered, the one which forbids <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the</hi> Jews, <hi>the other which grants it,</hi> Lev. 25.35, 38. <hi>The reaſon is, becauſe they were Brethren amongſt themſelves, had one common father after a ſingular manner, and the Inheritance, and the Goods of the land immediately delivered them by God, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort common, which were the foundation of that Political Law, as far as it concerned

            <p>I have been the longer in this Quotation, becauſe of the ſeveral reaſons it carries in it.

            <p>
               <hi>I come</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to that Right which God granted to the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Nation,</hi> Deut. 23.19. Thou ſhalt not lend to thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon Uſury, <hi>&amp;c. here they that judge all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury to be against the law of Nature, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, what is ſpoken of lending upon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe to a Stranger, to be a permiſſion of</hi> Fact, <hi>not of</hi> Right: <hi>which neither the words admit, nor ever was ſo underſtood by that People to whom the Law was given: I have</hi> Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:107146:47"/>— <hi>and</hi> Philo <hi>for Witneſſes, — to whom all the Rabbines conſent; from whence it is ſufficiently apparent, if I miſtake not, that the Law was underſtood of Citizens to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Citizens, which alſo the words in</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticus <hi>ſhew: for there alſo uſury is forbidden, this reaſon being added,</hi> that thy Brother may live by thee, Lev. 25.36. <hi>wherefore when in the</hi> Pſalms <hi>and in</hi> Ezek. <hi>he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended that exerciſeth not uſury, that is to be underſtood according to the laws preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Ambroſe, <hi>and ſome following him, by</hi> Strangers <hi>understand thoſe ſeven Nations with whom the</hi> Jews <hi>had a juſt War, and he thinks it no wonder if it were lawful to take uſe of thoſe whom it was lawful to kill. But neither doth this Interpretaetion agree to the words of the law: for ſeeing Strangers are oppoſed to Brethren,</hi> i. e. <hi>Citizens, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, not theſe or theſe, but all Strangers muſt be underſtood. Add, that it in no wiſe became the gravity of a Law, to grant uſury towards thoſe, whom they were bound wholly to ſlay. The cauſe of the difference therefore was this, That God would have the</hi> Jews <hi>to obſerve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, not only thoſe Offices which are common amongſt all men, one towards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and which in strict reaſon of right and due: but alſo many Offices of a nearer tye and charity: As in the Law of Servants, Pledges, plucking the Ears of Corn, and many other may be ſeen, — But that Law
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107146:47"/>of</hi> Moſes, <hi>in that it reſpects the State of that Nation, and was given to one Nation only, binds not others, any farther than it contains a Natural Equity. What Chriſt would have us do, ſeeing there is no particular Command extant of this matter, muſt be collected from general Rules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far <hi>Grotius.</hi> Think on it once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, how unlikely it was, that the <hi>Jews</hi> might lend to thoſe Nations, whom they were bound utterly to deſtroy: And <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. <hi>begin. they are charged to make no Covenant with them, nor ſhew any Mercy to them, nor enter Marriages with them:</hi> And the reaſon there given is, <hi>becauſe theſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would entice them from the Service of God to Idolatry:</hi> which ſame reaſon would alſo hinder them from lending, or having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny civil Commerce with them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For a farther Confirmation of what is here ſaid, take a parallel place, <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.2, 3. where the like oppoſition is between Brother and Stranger, and the like privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge there granted to the former in the matter of the Releaſe, that is elſewhere gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him in the matter of Uſury: All Debts were to be releaſed every ſeventh year, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Of a Stranger thou mayſt exact it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but that which is thine with thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thine hand ſhall releaſe:</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. And yet he made it before one of his Arguments againſt Uſury, becauſe the Divel was a Metaphorical Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Though I have not thought any Argument of cogency could be deduced from this Text,<note place="margin">De Conſc. p. 375.</note> yet I ſhall propoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration what the Learned <hi>Ames</hi> writes: <hi>Hither</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>may be referred, that it is very probable from that Parable of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents,</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:107146:48"/>Mat. 25.27. <hi>Not only that there was ſome uſury of Money-Changers in common uſe amongſt the</hi> Jews, <hi>but alſo that it was not diſallowed of Our Lord: becauſe under that Similitudo he requires a ſpiritual Office, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt hint of any diſallowance, the which he was wont to uſe in other Parables, which illuſtrated duty from diſallowed Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, as</hi> Luke 16.8.</p>
            <p>The Fourth Objection that Mr. <hi>J.</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,<note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> contains this Plea: <hi>That Uſury is by God forbidden to the Poor only, and not toward the Rich, and therefore lending to the Rich for uſe is lawful, As</hi> Exod. 22.25. Lev. 25.36.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>J.</hi> Anſw. <hi>This is a very ſpecious Plea, I confeſs: but yet I hope through mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to overthrow it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The moſt wiſe God foreſeing how ſome would abuſe ſuch namings of the poor people, leaveth out the poor in the repetition of his Laws,</hi> i. e. <hi>in</hi> Deut. 23.19. Thou ſhalt not lend upon Uſury to thy Brother: <hi>Mark,</hi> Brother, <hi>And is not the Rich thy Brother too?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. I like this anſwer the worſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it reflects upon the Wiſdom of God, in effect, attributing over-right to him: as if the inconveniences happening had not been fore-ſeen at firſt; the which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſights are frequent with men, which they
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107146:49"/>are wont to rectifie by an after-act, revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the former. But far be it from us, that we ſhould thus charge God with fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſee farther yet, that Mr. <hi>J.</hi> is out in his reckoning, and that, where men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made of lending in the repetition of the Law, the Poor were not left out upon any ſuch account, as is pretended; you ſhall find the Poor expreſly mentioned in the buſineſs of lending, in this Book of <hi>Deut.</hi> viz. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.7, 8. <hi>If there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you a</hi> poor <hi>man of one of thy Brethren, within any of thy Gates, — thou ſhalt not harden thy heart, nor ſhut thy hand from thy poor Brother: but thou ſhalt open thy hand wide unto him, and ſhalt ſurely lend him ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for his need, in that which he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This place joyneth <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Brother</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.17. the place ſo often pointed to, and the which was written long after this <hi>foreſight</hi> he mentions; there we have theſe expreſſions: — <hi>that have taken off his hand from the Poor, and hath not received <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury or Increaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. To come cloſer yet; <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.19. where 'tis pleaded, the Poor is left out, and Brother put in its room; yet there, ſay I, the expreſſions, in effect, do limit it to the Poor, for who are wont to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Victuals, and the like, ſave the Poor?
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107146:49"/>Hear <hi>Zanchy; Alſo put not out thy meat to uſury; therefore he ſpake of the Poor.</hi> And <hi>Rivet: Let us conſider the places:</hi>

                  <hi>P.</hi> 284.</note> — Deut. 23. <hi>where is no mention of the Poor, We mean all, and do contend, that that third place contains the ſame reſtriction, if not in expreſs terms; yet both in the comparing of what goes before, and what follows after: for when he injoyns, that none ſhould lend to his Neighbour, either Money or Victuals u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon uſury; he ſhews that uſury to be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which ſhould be received from him, who had need of meat; and borrowed money, not for that end we have ſpoken off,</hi> viz. <hi>for gain; but for his Maintenance, forced through neceſſity, as is evinced from other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. I ſhall add farther Teſtimonies: Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his Directory, <hi>Part.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 125. §. 18. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury</hi> [as by him ſtated] <hi>is not forbidden us by the Law of</hi> Moſes. 1. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> Moſes <hi>law never did forbid it: for</hi> 1. <hi>It is expreſly forbidden as an act of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifulneſs; and therefere forbidden only to the Poor and to Brethren.</hi> 2. <hi>It is expreſly allowed to be uſed to Strangers,</hi> Deut. 23.19, 20. <hi>to whom nothing unjuſt or unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table might be done: onely ſuch a meaſure of Charity was not required toward them, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Brethren. — So that the Prohibition of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury is in the Law it ſelf reſtrained only to their lending to the Poor: but in the Prophets
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107146:50"/>who do but reprove the ſin, it is expreſſed without that limitation, partly becauſe it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the meaning of the Law to be known, which the Prophets did but apply: and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe there was little or no lending uſed amongſt the Jews, but to the needy, as an act of charity.</hi> 2. <hi>And if it had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in</hi> Moſes <hi>only, it would not extend to Chriſtians now, becauſe the Law of</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <hi>as ſuch as is not in force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. What need of farther witneſs? The firſt Law againſt Uſury limits it to the poor, and there is no Law or Comment following in Scripture that extends it to the rich, why then ſhould we extend it to the rich? The Law ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not lend to thy Brother that is waxen poor by thee upon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury:</hi> that is, (ſaith Mr. <hi>J.</hi> in his Comment) Thou ſhalt not lend to the poor or rich upon Uſury: Strange Comment!</p>
            <p>Again, In <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. The Law againſt Uſury is not only reſtrained to the poor by name, but his poverty is intimated as the reaſon of this free Lending: So it runs, <hi>If thy Brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee, then thou ſhalt relieve him, that he may live with thee:</hi> This laſt reaſon is twice repeated: All this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating the perſons to be ſuch as borrow for a Livelyhood; neceſſity is the reaſon of his borrowing. <q>Where the object and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:107146:50"/>reaſon of a prohibition ceaſeth, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition alſo ceaſeth, ſaith <hi>Rivet.</hi>
               </q> There are ſeveral Laws mentioned in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that are alſo limited to the poor, ſee <hi>v.</hi> 25.35, 39, 47. And the ſame general reaſon annext to them all, <hi>viz. I am the Lord your God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>J.</hi> 2. <hi>And what were thoſe uſurers whom</hi> Nehemiah <hi>did ſo blame and condemn for uſury? were they not ſuch as lent to them that had Lands, Vineyards,</hi> &amp;c. Neh. 5.6, 9, 11. <hi>Will you uſurers call ſuch Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men poor?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>J.</hi> himſelf called them poor borrowers; And were he in the like caſe with moſt of them, he would count his Condition poor. Some of them ſo poor, they were forced to ſell their Children to keep themſelves from ſtarving, after they had morgaged their Lands and Vineyards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But whether they are to be called poor or no, it ſeems they were for that preſent very neceſſitous; otherwiſe they would not have mortgaged their Eſtates, Lands, Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To buy Corn, and for a Livelyhood; nor have ſuffered their Sons, and Daughters to have been brought into bondage.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here I conſult <hi>Rivet</hi> again.<note place="margin">P. 279.</note> 
               <hi>We grant there muſt be lending to a poor man place in Extremity, not only without the hope of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:107146:51"/>an early return, but alſo although there ſhould be no hope of the principal: farther, to thoſe which otherwiſe do not want goods, but are in ſuch a condition wherein for a time they cannot injoy their own, loan muſt be granted freely, which they require to the neceſſary ſupport of their life for a time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. In my Animadverſions on what is written by Mr. <hi>Capel</hi> on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I have given a fuller Anſwer to this place, <hi>viz. Neh.</hi> 5. Only this here; Let it be conſidered, whether the Caſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned were not extraordinary; as was that of the Primitive Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> when they ſold their poſſeſſions, and laid down the price at the Apoſtles feet. And I think thoſe none of the wiſeſt Divines (whatever their Zeal may be) that draw Ordinary Rules from Extraordinary Caſes or Examples: As they that would deſtroy propriety, and make all things Common, from the foreſaid inſtance of the primitive Chriſtians: So they that would bring in a neceſſity on Miniſters ordinarily to work for a Livelyhood, becauſe the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> under Extraordinary Circumſtances did ſo.</p>
            <p>What Mr. <hi>J.</hi> ſaith (1.) Of a ſallacy of <hi>Cauſae non pro cauſa,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 36.</note> avails nothing. For (upon ſuppoſition that the Law it ſelf be not political and proper to the <hi>Jews,</hi> but univerſal, and in its full force to this
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:107146:51"/>day) I ſay, that uſury in Scripture is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden only with reſpect to the poor; or, whereſoever free lending is expreſt with its object, there the poor are expreſt or implied; and the reaſon uſed for free lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reacheth not others.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>J.</hi> 2. <hi>Fallacy of conſequence, for it doth not therefore follow a man may lend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on uſury to a rich man; no more than this, that a man may rob a rich man, becauſe it is written,</hi> Rob not the poor, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. I grant his reaſoning were good, if it were proved that all gain for Loan were a moral evil, or againſt Natures Law, as Robbery; but that cannot be proved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Text mentioned, there is a particular reaſon added, whereon the diſwaſion is grounded, or which was the temptation to the ſin, <hi>viz. Becauſe he is poor, taking occaſion from his poverty which is without power or defence,</hi> ſaith <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3.

The Law forbids taking uſe from a poor man, therefore it permits taking from the rich. This being ſaid, he knits many abſurd conſequences, which he pretends to be of the the like import: As,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107146:52"/>The Law forbids to oppreſs Widows or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans, therefore it permits, that ſuch as have huſbands and parents may be oppreſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But in ſuch Conſequences there is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimititude, becauſe oppreſſion and the like are evil in themſelves, as is clearly proved from other places, but it is not in it ſelf evil, to take any increaſe for loan, but in ſome caſes only, into which the rich man, while ſuch, falleth not.</hi>

This is more than I can ſee from the Text (or any other) the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers here being ſuch as borrowed Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als &amp; Money to ſupply their urgent neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but on the contrary there is a curſe upon the head of any that is liberal to the rich, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.16. <hi>He that oppreſſeth the poor to increaſe his riches, and he that giveth to the rich, ſhall ſurely come to want.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:107146:52"/> 2. Let the Reader obſerve how Mr. <hi>J.</hi> makes it our duty equally to <hi>lend freely</hi> to poor and rich. The Law ſaying, <hi>Thou ſhalt not lend upon uſury to thy Brother?</hi> And is not the Rich thy Brother too? ſaith he. In that the Law ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not lend upon uſury,</hi> It doth ſay, <hi>Thou ſhalt lend;</hi> Under this Prohibition (ſaith <hi>Ainſworth</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.20.) the contrary is commanded, <hi>that we ſhould lend unto our poor Brother freely, and not take again any thing more than was lent.</hi> And to our rich Brother too, ſaith Mr. <hi>J.</hi> But ſo far I think he will have but few of his mind. But if we are not bound <hi>to lend</hi> to the rich, I ſee not, how we can be <hi>bound</hi> to <hi>lend freely</hi> to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Of a truth there ſhould be ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference put between rich and poor in the buſineſs of lending: So thought the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107146:53"/>it, nor indeed reaſon nor Analogy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So then Mr. <hi>I.</hi> might have taken notice of others beſides Presbyterian and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational men,<note place="margin">p. 38.</note> that all allow of taking uſe of the Rich: here you have this learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctor putting a difference betwixt Poor and Rich in the tranſaction of <hi>Lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>J. I confeſs it, but doth God make Lending to the rich no ſin? I pray where is the place? ſhew it if you can.</hi>

               <hi>Reply:</hi> His Anſwer depends upon this Medium, <q>whatever is not expreſt in Scripture to be lawful, is ſinful:</q> the which, how weak it is I need not ſtand to ſhew: It being, as far as I have learnt, a certain rule, that in things of this nature, where Civil Contracts and dealings are concerned, whatſoever is no way forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, is lawful.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply:</hi> It may be reaſonably ſuppoſed; that it was this oppreſſive Uſury, that gave the occaſion to thoſe ſevere Laws againſt it: from which oppreſſive Uſury, they did not think themſelves, 'tis like, ſecure enough, unleſs they condemned all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.

            <p>What is urged by him out of the Rev. Biſhop <hi>Hall;</hi> I ſhall make ſo bold as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Hall: Nature teacheth, that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are not things capable of ſuperfetation: that the uſe of the Stock once received, it is not the lenders, but the borrowers: for the power and right of diſpoſing the Principal, is by Contract transferred for the time to the hands of him that receiveth it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Let it be obſerved how this learned Biſhop, On the ſame queſtion, doth as good as allow taking Uſe of the Rich, and is not, that I can find, of Mr. <hi>J</hi>'s mind, in making the expectation of gain, Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: only he is againſt binding by Contract to pay Uſe: Yet, <hi>In that the power and right of diſpoſing the Principal</hi> (as he ſays) <hi>is by Contract transferred to the borrower:</hi> I ſee no reaſon, why by the ſame <hi>Contract,</hi> a right to ſomewhat of the gains procured by this Money, may not be transferred to the lender.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall conſider what he pleads: <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teacheth, that Metals are not capable of ſuperfetation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. If they be capable of fetation, it is enough. Of all other, this ſeems to me the moſt barren Argument: Upon ſearch, I find that <hi>Calvin</hi> ſpeaking of this
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107146:63"/>Argument, <hi>that Money begets not Money,</hi> calls it a <hi>fooliſh, childiſh reaſon.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Bolton</hi> himſelf judgeth it <hi>a weak argument, and prejudicial to the cauſe it pleads for.</hi> But when the barenneſs of Metals is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I may ſafely think, it is not meant of Metals in the Mine; for there they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Natural Increaſe, at leaſt by appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <p>If it be meant of a <hi>Civil Increaſe,</hi> ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience manifeſteth, that Metals are not fruitleſs, but capable of producing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe: The World, I truſt, is not now to learn, that we ow the value of Metals, (I mean of currant Coyn) not to Natures Law, but to Civil and Human Inſtitution.

            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. But on what condition was this right transferred? or is the lender bound to transfer this right of uſing and diſpoſing his money to another, as rich, or richer than himſelf? and is not this right of uſing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> valuable? If ſo, (which cannot be denied) by the ſame Contract that the lender paſſeth away his right, may he not as juſtly, for this right transferred, have ſome gain ſecured to himſelf?</p>
            <p n="2">2. But this and the foregoing Argument being fully anſwered by <hi>Rivet,</hi> I ſhall tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe what he writes.</p>

            <p>They Reply: <hi>That will make nothing for his cauſe that takes any ſum above the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, but by this very thing his wickedneſs is reproved; for Money as by human indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry

            <p>
               <hi>What hath been ſaid, may ſerve for an anſwer to this Objection. For the Creditor may be conſidered, either as before the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of this money, whereof he is yet the owner; or after the voluntary delivery of the Money. In the firſt State, ſeeing he is the owner of the thing, he may Covenant before he deliver it. In the ſecond, if he abſolutely gives the Money without any other Covenant, then that the like Sum may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid, he hath parted with his right thereto, and may not demand any thing for its uſe: but we ſpeak not of what is lawful after the Money abſolutely delivered; but of the firſt condition, wherein the diſpoſing of the Money is in the hand of the Creditor, with a power either of not delivering it without a condition, or of delivering. Neither may it be object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the right of uſing the Money, or of any other Commodity which may be conſumed by uſing, cannot be distinguiſhed from the Commodity, and therefore nothing can juſtly be required for it: for that is nor abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true, — for that right is valuable, the which he that lends his Money wants.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. And to <hi>Jews</hi> they give leave to uſe their griping Uſuries, when they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove what is moderate in Chriſtians. I receive it from <hi>Hornbeck,</hi>

            <p>What ſay we more than is here ſaid?</p>

            <p n="5">5.

            <p n="2">2.

            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. No; <hi>Zanchy</hi> meant not ſurely that this condition ſhould have entred into the Contract (which was requiſite to have made it ſuretiſhip) but that the Lender ought out of charity thus to do: for if by Contract he were to bear a proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of his loſſes; then by the ſame alſo, he ought to have received a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable part of the others gains, be they never ſo great: whereas in the caſe of Lending for Uſe it is not ſo; his penſion being ſtated within ſuch a Sum; and let the Borrower make the beſt of his money: which is ſometimes double, ſometime four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To what comes in to the Lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:107146:71"/> 2. That this Condition mentioned is not intended as part of the Contract, but to be left free to the Creditors charity; it farther appears, becauſe though the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal it ſelf may be juſtly ſecured by Bond, yet there may be caſes wherein this may admit of an abatement, as well as the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus: ſo ſay our Divines.<note place="margin">Vol. 1. p. 63.</note> So Mr. <hi>Perkins — He muſt be ſo far from taking gain ſometimes, that he muſt not require the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, if his debtor be by inevitable and juſt Caſualties brought behind, and it be alſo plain that he could not make, no not by great diligence, any Commodity of the money bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">Sen. de benef. l. 7. c. 16.</note> 
               <hi>What</hi> (ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) <hi>doſt thou judge our Anceſtors to have been ſo imprudent, that they thought it not to be moſt unjuſt, to make the ſame account of one, who hath ſpent his money received from a Creditor on his luſt and gaming, as of another who loſt anothers Goods with his own, through fire, plundering, or ſome ſadder accident?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Still I ſay, this abatement made on the Creditors part, in Caſe of the Debtors loſs, is free and of his own choice, and not part of the Compact: It may be this will be received from Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Practic. caſes. p. 53.</note> though not from me. <hi>Yea, but you ſay the money or goods miſcarried, either by robbery, or falſe truſt, e're you could employ them to any profit at all; this will not excuſe you; after
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107146:72"/>they came into your power you are reſponſible for them, what Compaſſion this may work in the good nature of the Owner for the favour of an abatement, muſt be left to his own Breſt; your tye to reſtitution is not the leſs; for it is ſuppoſed, had they remained in the Owners hands, they had been ſafe: If it were not your fault, yet it was your croſs, that they miſcarried; and who ſhould bear your Croſs but your ſelf?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Biſhop looks on this abatement not as an act of ſtrict Juſtice, but of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Compaſſion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I doubt not to ſay, there is room enough for the like Compaſſion between buyer and ſeller, the Landlord and Tenant; when that the bargain, through inevitable accidents, proves very ſore and burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the party concerned.</p>

               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. If we ſay, with ſome, that the Law concerning Uſury was political, and proper to that Nation, and ſo extenſive to all therein, the objection is anſwered: or, if we ſay, the Law was intended only for the benefit of the poor, from whom it was, and is ſtill, unlawful to take uſe: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe hinder but that Widows and Orphans may now improve their ſtocks, left them, this way.</p>

               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. If this neceſſity be of natures making, and he borrows to keep himſelf alive; here lending ought to be free, or elſe it will prove biting: but if the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be only occaſional, ſuch as may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times befal men of wealth and eſtates, and ſuch as many times ſends the buyer to the Market; what reaſon or ſhadow of reaſon can be thought of, that any ſhould be bound to lend to this man freely? that he ſhould grow the richer by my loan, and I the poorer by the ſame? may not the owner of two bargains be bound to ſpare me one upon as good grounds?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Who forced him?</hi> Nothing but his own conveniences drew him to it: If the force were cauſed by the lender, it were ſomewhat to the purpoſe. Saith <hi>Grotius,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>It is not a uſing of force, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe a thing under a certain condition: if it be any force, it is one of thy own uſing toward thy ſelf,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> denys (ſaith <hi>Grotius</hi>) that <hi>he who having gotten by merchandize or ſome honeſt Employment,</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>J.</hi> Obj. 4. <hi>But what need had you to trouble your ſelf ſo much about <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury, and ſo to appear againſt it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is beyond diſpute between us, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinful practices, and ſuch eſpecially as are moſt in faſhion, ought to be preached and printed down: as alſo whether there be not too much of oppreſſion to be found in the Land, under the covert of Uſury, as well as in buying and ſelling, and in the Adminiſtration of Juſtice too. But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moderate gain from Loan be ſuch, he knows is in diſpute between Learned, pious, and good men. And I think, a man may hold either ſide of the queſtion, and his ſalvation be little concerned in it: only I ſhall ſay, the practice thereof on one hand is of great conſequence to the Nation we live in, as well as to the Eſtates of many ſingle perſons: and the peremptory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of all that uſe it, is of dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous conſequence on the other hand, upon ſuppoſals that it be falſe. And whereas he appears the only Champion herein in theſe days; I ſhall not determine whether it be becauſe he exceeds others in Zeal, or from his unacquaintedneſs with the State of the Nation, and the Intereſt thereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon Lending: yet, to him plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:107146:85"/>
               <hi>that it belongs to him as a watchman thus to warn; ſome will be ready to reply;</hi> how hath he watched, that hath deferred this work theſe thirty years? for ſo long time hath paſt at leaſt ſince his Sermons againſt Uſury were preached, afore this Treatiſe of his was Printed.</p>
            <p>Being now come to the laſt Chapter that contains his application, inſtead of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer whereto, I ſhall draw up a Scheme of his diſcourſe by way of ſummary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal; wherein as in a Map may be ſeen the cenſure that is paſt; The applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof I ſhall leave to himſelf to make.</p>
            <p>After Mr. <hi>J.</hi> hath repreſented the Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer as vile as he can, heaping on him all the opprobrious terms that came in his way; and damned him ten times over to the pit of Hell: 1. Leaſt he ſhould be miſtaken by his Readers as intending all this for griping Uſurers, and devouring Cormorants only, and not for others that take moderate gain, and mean no harm: he plainly ſays, he takes in all, and intends this diſcourſe of all, even of ſuch too as take moderate uſe, <hi>p.</hi> 46, 50, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And makes them as <hi>bad as Adulterers and Thieves, yea worſe,</hi> p. 23. and 48.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But may not ſome lend for gain, that yet deſign good to their Neighbour? No:

            <p n="4">4. However, may not the caſe be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as to Orphans and Widows, who have frequently no other way of improving their Money? Not ſo neither: <hi>

            <p n="5">5. Suppoſe then that all ſuch Uſury be a ſin, may we not charitably think, that ſuch as have a hand in it coming to the ſight thereof, may repent of this, as we find ſome others do of ſome other ſins? he leaves not room for ſo much charity; <hi>For uſurers ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom repent, but at laſt into Hell they go:</hi> p. 24.</p>
            <p n="6">6. May there not be hopes, that ſome ſuch do it ignorantly, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and as the Patriarchs lived in the ſin of Polygamy, and yet repenting thereof in the Lump, amongſt their other unknown ſins, found mercy? I cannot learn he hath ſo much kindneſs for them neither: his whole diſcourſe, and particularly his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication makes directly againſt this; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting

That ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If he then have ſo little Charity for the practiſer of Uſury, what charity has he yet for thoſe many learned, grave, and (to all appearance) Godly Divines, that in the integrity of their hearts have plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Lawfulneſs of moderate Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Surely he will honour theſe: If you will take his thoughts from his words, theſe likewiſe are no better, nor worſe than damned; unleſs they repented of this; the which it is more than we know they did, <hi>p.</hi> 39. <hi>How wilt thou anſwer it</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>at that great day? when Chriſt ſhall ask thee, how durſt thou preach or ſay, that it is lawful to lend to the rich upon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury, when thou never heardeſt me ſay ſo?

            </p>
            <p>This, I think, is the only objection, that Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath, which was omitted by Mr. <hi>J.</hi> For what reaſon he himſelf knows: Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I think the deciſion thereof would bring no ſmall helps towards ſatisfaction in this Controverſie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. B.</hi> Doth not deny the queſtion, neither do I ſee how he could: For who is there that doth not think the Loan of 100 <abbr>l.</abbr> for a Year worth ſomewhat? And if it be worth ſomewhat, 'tis worth money, that being the common meaſure whereby the worth of any thing is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued. And if the Loan, or the uſe of this Loan be worth ſomewhat, where is the wrong, if a man take for it what it is worth? Is the buyer bitten, if he gives no more for a commodity than it is worth? If not, how is the borrower bitten if he have a penniworth for his peny? All that can be
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107146:88"/>ſaid is, this is buying, not borrowing: I reply, call it what you will as long as we are agreed in the thing, that here is no wrong done; there is no reaſon we ſhould differ about words or Notions. Let us now weigh <hi>Mr. B</hi>'s Anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> B. <hi>So money which was ordained to be the price of all Wares, and the meaſure of all Bargains, is made a Ware, contrary to the nature of it. For,</hi> Quod eſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium venditionis, non poteſt eſſe termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. That money is uſed as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument for exchange or merchandizing, is from humane inſtitution, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned thereto by nature. Time was when Gold and Silver were forbidden in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonian</hi> Commonwealth,<note place="margin">Sen. de ben. l. 5. c. 14.</note> and only Iron the currant coyn. And another while Leather having the publick ſtamp on it, paſſed there for money.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Money may be exchanged for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">De Jure. p. 229. p. 238.</note> 
               <hi>That exchange is more ſimple and ancient than buying:</hi> And that <hi>Tacitus</hi> of the <hi>Germans,</hi> ſaith, <hi>They that live more inward</hi> [viz. from the Sea] <hi>do more ſimply and antiently uſe the Exchange of Wares. Grotius</hi> alſo writes of <hi>Changing Money for Money, which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the</hi> Greeks <hi>call</hi> Collybus, <hi>and the Merchants at this day,</hi> Exchange, <hi>As alſo of Money brought from</hi> Illyricum <hi>to</hi> Italy <hi>as a Ware.</hi>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:107146:89"/>Again, <hi>Money is delivered, that after ſome time, ſo much and the ſame in kind may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid in loan; which hath place in thoſe things which conſiſt in number, weight and meaſure, as well other things as Money.</hi> And how common is it to exchange Silver for Gold, and Gold for Silver, giving ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what above the currant price thereof? May not that which is <hi>Medium hujus ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionis,</hi> be <hi>terminus alterius?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But in this caſe before us, the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower pays not for the Money lent, ſo much as for the Uſe of this Money lent, or rather for the right and power to uſe that Money which before was none of his, and for the advantages attending the ſame: whereof <hi>Spanhemius</hi> writes thus:<note place="margin">Dub.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Overplus is required for the undue Office performed, for parting from our own right to the Money for ſometime, which was ours, and might have been kept by us: for the liberty and opportunity we deprive our ſelves of, for a while, of laying out that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney on <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes and Commodities of our own; for power granted the Debtor of gaining, and alſo for the advantage or gain he hath made of our Money: But all theſe thing are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, and ſomewhat may be demanded for them.</hi>

Thou bidſt thy rich Neighbour ſometime, that which he eateth is worth money; yet thou wilt take none, but think it foul ſcorn it ſhould be offered: why? becauſe it is an act of kindneſs, of neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bood and friendſhip.</hi>

               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. To the firſt ſort of Gueſts, <hi>viz. Poor Neighbours,</hi> I would adviſe free lending, as well as free entertainment to be uſed.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Dinners are made at Common-Inns, and Victualing-Houſes, where men pay for them, and good reaſon they ſhould.</p>
            <p>If you ſay, that men are not here invited, but invite themſelves: I anſwer, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough however to ſhew that Dinners may be allowed for without offence; and they that lend, do not always invite Cuſtomers, but are ſought unto.

            <p n="4">4. When the rich invites his friends, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually there is a recompence made for this, by the like invitation again, and it may be, he that made the firſt Dinner expects it, and would take it amiſs, not to be re-invited, you will not allow the lender <hi>to hope for any thing again:</hi> Or if you will give him leave to look for the like kindneſs another time, I doubt not to ſay, that this is mony-worth, and ſo eſteemed by moſt that know their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>

            <p>There be Divines, that hold this Law to be Moral, and yet ſome Uſury to be lawful: They are of Opinion, that taking Uſe from the Poor is only prohibited, who is expreſſed in the firſt writing of the Law, and to be underſtood in all after repetitions of the Law, or prohibitions of Uſury. And others that look on the Law as Political, yet acknowledge a general Equity in this, as in other Judicial Laws of God by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> and ſo far they concern Chriſtians al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.<note place="margin">De Jure p. 10.</note> From <hi>Grotius</hi> I underſtand, ſome things may be morally honeſt, becauſe they may he commendably done, and yet their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites not morally diſhoneſt; and for this, he inſtanceth in Uſury: <hi>To the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the Law of Nature, we muſt obſerve, that ſome things are ſaid to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. It is rather an exception to the Law, then a permiſſion: and things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted from a prohibiting Law, may be in themſelves lawful, and uſually are ſo antecedent to that Law.</p>

               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. It is a miſtake, that the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away of an <hi>Innocent</hi> Wife was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the <hi>Jews.</hi> It is an Aſſertion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the expreſs letter of the Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. <hi>beginning. — Becauſe he hath found ſome uncleanneſs in her.</hi>

That of the Apoſtle is alſo known, evils are not to be done, that good may come; and therefore things that are abſolutely ſuch, are not to be permitted by an expreſs ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The inſtance of Divorce is inconſequent; for neither is Divorce of that kind and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or any ſuch thing which hath in it an intrinſecal diſhoneſty contrary to the Law of nature the which is by the Schoolmen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If what is here ſpoken be reaſon (as I think it is) then it evacuates the two following reaſons uſed by Mr. <hi>B.</hi> for this toleration of Uſury, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The hard hartedneſs of the Jews:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The injuſtiee of the Gentiles, with whom they did traffick, ſuch as they would be ſure to exact <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury of the Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="178" facs="tcp:107146:94"/>
            <p> Which Arguments ſeem not of force enough to bear up the weight laid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>For 1. How could any man <hi>be ſure</hi> that the Gentiles would practice Uſury up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Jews, if it were (as they ſay) a ſin againſt nature, and generally by the Heathens condemned?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither is it likely that God would give a poſitive toleration for one ſin, to prevent another.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And it ſeems very derogatory to the Laws and Holineſs of God, to give a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive permiſſion to ſuch practices, as the very Heathen would cry ſhame upon. (I am ſure Chriſtians are wont to look on it as no ſmall blemiſh in the Heathen Laws for things of this nature:) or that he ſhould permit the Jews to uſe injuſtice towards other Nations, becauſe there was a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility they would uſe the ſame injuſtice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Jews.</p>
            <p>Thus you have his plea, if by <hi>Stranger</hi> be underſtood the Stranger at large. But if by Stranger be meant the <hi>Canaanite,</hi> which he takes to be the right. Then he Anſwers thus;</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>B. Permiſſion of Uſury toward the Canaanite doth no more prove the Law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Uſury not to be Moral, than the allowance of manſlaughter in War doth prove the Law forbidding Murder to be judicial,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:107146:94"/>for although the Law condemning Uſury be never ſo perpetual or moral; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as other Commandments of God, ſo is it to be underſtood with this Limitation, and reſtraint,</hi> viz. <hi>Unleſs God otherwiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. This limitation would ſeem ſtrange, if applied to all Gods Laws: for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, how ill it ſounds, to underſtand the Command thus: <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery,</hi> unleſs God otherwiſe appoint: Thou ſhalt not ſteal, or ſerve Idols, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Unleſs God otherwiſe appoint. I ſay it is a great reflection of diſhonour upon the wiſe God, thus to interpret his Laws.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The inſtances brought of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s killing his Son, and of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> taking away the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> Goods, will not prove the thing intended: For, 1. Theſe things were commanded, and ſo made lawful after this Command. 2. It had been ſin in them not to have done them; will any ſay ſo of Uſury toward the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? was this Commanded? then it had been their ſin, not to have done it. But he ſaid before, it was permitted only as the Bill of Divorce; and permiſſion, ſaith he, is only of things evil, even after they are permitted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the Inſtances mentioned there was no diſpenſing with Gods Laws in a proper ſenſe: Murder is the taking of the life of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:107146:95"/>a perſon without a lawful Warrant or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; This <hi>Abraham</hi> wanted not; and therefore his fact, if accompliſhed, had not been Murder, nor againſt that Law. Theft is the taking away of anothers Goods without right: did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> do ſo, when they ſpoyled the <hi>Aegyptians?</hi> If it be ſaid, that the one had been Murder, and the other Theft, unleſs God had given them leave for doing of what they did, and therefore the Law was diſpenſed with. I reply: ſo, what the Executioner doth in taking away a mans life, would be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and what the Bailiff does in diſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Goods, would be theft, without a Warrant from the Magiſtrate for ſo doing; yet none will dare ſay, that therefore the Magiſtrate doth or can diſpence with thoſe Laws.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We have heard before from <hi>Grotius,</hi> that the Law of Nature is immutable even to God himſelf:<note place="margin">De Jure p. 10.</note> This is ſpoken, not by way of check to his power, but in that it carries an inconſiſtency to his will and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nature. I ſhall borrow ſomewhat more from the ſame Author on this Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Law of Nature is the dictate of right reaſon, ſhewing an Act to have either a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral turpitude, or moral neceſſity from its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience or diſconvenience, with a rational nature, and conſequently ſuch an Act to be either forbidden or commanded by God the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:107146:95"/>Author of nature. The actions concerning which there is ſuch a dictate extant, are lawful or unlawful in themſelves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are underſtood to be neceſſarily command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or forbidden by God: By which mark this Law differs not only from Mans Law, but from the Divine voluntary, which doth not command or forbid thoſe things, which in themſelves, and of their own nature, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lawful or unlawful, but makes them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful by forbidding, lawful by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again: <hi>Yet it ſometimes comes to paſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 4.</note> 
               <hi>that in thoſe Acts wherein the light of Nature doth determine ſomewhat, a certain ſhadow of change deceiveth the Non-obſervant, when in truth the Law of Nature is not changed, it being unchangeable: but the thing of which the Law of nature doth determine receives ſome change.</hi> e. g. <hi>If a Creditor,</hi> &amp;c. — <hi>So if God command any to be ſlain; if what is anothers to be taken away; Murder or Theft will not become Lawful, theſe words carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinfulneſs within them; but it ſhall not be murder or theft, which is done by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the ſupream Lord of Life and Goods.</hi> Thus far <hi>Grotius.</hi> And indeed, how can this be a diſpenſing with the Law of nature, the higheſt Law of nature it ſelf being, that God muſt be obeyed? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we ſhould imagine one of natures Laws to be contrary to another.</p>
            <pb n="182" facs="tcp:107146:96"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> There is one difference more to be obſerved between the inſtances brought, and what they ſuppoſe Uſury to be, for they aſſert Uſury to be <hi>In it ſelf, and by the Law of nature unlawful, ſuch as Adultery,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mr. B. p. 47. p. 13. p. 45.</note> 
               <hi>Lying and Theft is.</hi> Again, <hi>Biting is individual and eſſential to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it. And from the Schoolmen; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is a ſin not only in it ſelf, but according to it ſelf; and therefore cannot be made good by any Circumſtance. Will they ſay the like of taking away the Goods or Life of another?</hi> Are theſe ſo ſinful in themſelves, and againſt the Law of nature, that they can be made good by no Circumſtances? We ſee they were made good by the Command of God: we know they may be made good by the Magiſtrates lawful Warrant. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it appears the inſtances will not reach the mark; unleſs he had inſtanced in Theft and Murder, which carry a natural ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in them: but neither of theſe could be affirmed of <hi>Abrahams</hi> killing his Son, or of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſpoyling the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Concerning the latter of theſe; It is commonly taken for granted, that the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> Fact had been ſinful, ſecluding the ſpecial Command of God for their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and according to this ſuppoſition I have formed my Anſwer foregoing: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I think I need not have granted ſo
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:107146:96"/>much, but have called in queſtion their ſuppoſition. I know it was the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary injunction of <hi>Jehovah</hi> put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fact; but doubt whether it were for this end to legitimate that, which had been otherwiſe ſinful. Let us ſee what the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did: ſaith our Tranſlation,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.35, 36.</note> 
               <hi>They borrowed of the</hi> Egyptians <hi>Jewels of Silver, &amp;c.</hi> And was not this fact of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing in it ſelf lawful? After they had thus borrowed, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were urgent upon them, and thruſt them out of the Land in haſte,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.22.</note> 
               <hi>Preſently after this grant</hi> (<hi>ſaith</hi> Diodate) <hi>the</hi> Egyptians <hi>moved War against the</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>and did unjuſtly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault them: ſo that by right their ſpoils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Victors, who were aſſaulted, which was brought to paſs by Gods ſecret pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to recompence his people for the ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very they had endured in</hi> Egypt.</p>
            <p>The word tranſlated, <hi>to borrow,</hi> is <hi>Shaal,</hi> which primarily ſignifies to <hi>ask,</hi> ſo rendred by <hi>Diodate,</hi> ſo by <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremelius:</hi> God bad the People, ask of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Inſtruments of Silver, and Gold and Raiment: was not the thing in it ſelf lawful, even antecedent to the ſpecial Command from God? if you ſay, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with a promiſe of reſtoring; that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved, and that had been a lye in them, and therein they had gone beyond the Command: if it be urged, the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:107146:97"/>deſigned to lend only, and not to give: neither can that be proved: <hi>They gave to them asking, [dederunt eis petenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus]</hi> ſay <hi>Jun.</hi> and <hi>Trem. Exod.</hi> 12.36. neither is it likely, they ſhould deliver theſe Jewels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with ſuch an intent, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were juſt upon taking their farewel of them. If it be demanded, how came it to paſs that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were ſo free and liberal? The Scripture it ſelf will remove this ſcruple, <hi>The Lord gave the People favour in the ſight of the Egyptians, ſo that they gave them what they asked.</hi> The Lord inclined the hearts of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to be thus free and bountiful: if it be again urged, that they are ſaid <hi>to ſpoil the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> that is but ſpoken <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; and relates to the event, rather than to the action; <hi>ſpoiling</hi> properly ſignifying a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile, forcible taking away of anothers Goods, which in this caſe, was not: but this may receive ſome farther light, by comparing it with <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.9. <hi>Thus God,</hi> ſaid <hi>Jacob, hath taken away the Cattle of your father, and given them to me.</hi> If it be again inquired, what was Gods intent in putting the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> upon this demanding inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Silver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, God had then the building of his Sanctuary in his eye, whereto much of the things they received, proved ſerviceable, and was after conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for all was not caſt away upon the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Calf.</p>
            <pb n="185" facs="tcp:107146:97"/>
            <p> Having ſpoken of that Queſtion that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> borrowing, what I thought requiſite to remove that rub out of the way, I return to attend Mr. <hi>B.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>B. God appointed his People to deſtroy the</hi> Canaanites, <hi>and it was fitteſt by little and little, — uſurie was therefore a fit Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo to eat them out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Believe it he that can. I can call this no other than a groundleſs furmiſe, as having no footing on reaſon, or Scripture; the latter not affording the leaſt diſcovery that any of the Curſed Nations were eaten out by this means.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neither will the conjecture receive any help from Reaſon. Suppoſe a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to ſhew no kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to any of their neighbour Nations; but to deſtroy them utterly, and root them out; would any think that this Command were obeyed by lending to them upon U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury? or that this were a likely means to effect it?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If you look to the end of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for extirpation; ſeems it likely, that the <hi>Jews</hi> might lawfully exerciſe converſe with the Curſed Nations, in lending to them; when they were commanded not to ſuffer them to dwell in the Land,<note place="margin">Exod. 23.32, 33. Deut. 7.2.</note> nor make a Covenant with them, nor ſhew mercy to them; but utterly to ſmite and deſtroy them: and that too, for this reaſon prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:107146:98"/>leſt theſe Nations ſhould infect them with Idolatry, and ſo draw them off from the pure Worſhip of God?</p>
            <p>Q. 3. <hi>Whether it be lawful to contract for certain gain, whiles the gains of the borrower are uncertain?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>B.</hi> holds the negative, and that as univerſally true, or elſe his Argument would not prove the thing by him deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. This ſtring is often harped on: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, <hi>p.</hi> 18. <hi>Great and certain gain accrues to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer, ſometime out of little gain, ſometime out of no gain; ſometimes out of loſs; always out of uncertainties; always out of labour and pains, out of care and coſt, out of hazard and peril to the borrower: is this conſcionable?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Whereas he ſaith, <hi>Great gain,</hi> It is not ſo great now, as in his days.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Not ſo great, as where greater ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards are run, leſs gain being expected and taken, becauſe of the leſs hazard run.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Would it be reaſonable, that the Creditor ſhould run all hazards at this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage; ſo that if he gains to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, he gains but 6 <hi>per Cent.</hi> but upon the Debtors miſcarriages, he may poſſibly loſe not only 6 in the 100, but the whole 100? And yet the lender knows to his
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:107146:98"/>coſt, that this hazard is not ſeldom run too.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Suppoſe he then covenants for <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain gain,</hi> it may juſtly admit of a doubt, whether this can be proved conſiſtent with the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which yet they plead reacheth us too, as being moral and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual. And is not this <hi>[lucrum ex mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuo pactum]</hi> gain covenanted for from len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? do they not alſo ſay, we are bound to lend freely to all that we lend to, not hoping for any thing again, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not any gain, either certain or uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Suppoſe then that men might lend for uncertain gain, <hi>i. e.</hi> truſting to the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower's courteſie, who frequently is to ſeek what his gains by the loan are; but more frequently diſſembles his gains, and magnifies his loſſes: the gains on theſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, would prove <hi>uncertain</hi> indeed; and the Principal too, if left to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of many borrowers; the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the men of our times being well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the Son of <hi>Sirach, Ecccleſ.</hi> 29.4, 7.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Might not the ſame that is ſaid here by him, be affirmed of other Contractors, and particularly of him that ſets out his ground to farm? doth not certain gain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to him, ſometimes out of little gain, ſometimes out of no gain, ſometimes out of
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:107146:99"/>loſs, always out of uncertainties, always out of labour and pain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet this is held conſcionable.<note place="margin">De Jure. 235.</note> 
               <hi>In farming</hi> (ſaith <hi>Grotius</hi>) <hi>the uſe of the Money is recompenſed with the fruit of the Farm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>The borrower</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>B. pays the uſe, always out of labour and pains:</hi> As if no lender took labour and pains for procuring the money, before he could lend it.</p>

               <hi>He that letteth any thing, beareth the hazard of the thing he letts. As the Landlord of the Ground, not only of the Title; but alſo of all Caſualties and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties any way incident, as over-flowing by Sea, Invaſion by enemies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in which caſes he is as well to loſe his Rent, as the Tenant his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and charges.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. For extraordinary Caſes there cannot be expected ordinary Rules: when ſuch happen, there ſhould be forbearance and moderation uſed both by the ſetter and lender. I think 'tis part of their Contract to ſecure the Tenant in the quiet poſſeſſion of what he rents, that being ſubject to more cavils and moleſtations than the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney lent is. Who ſeeth not that in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings of Water, Invaſions of Enemies, money may be better ſecured than the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et poſſeſſion of Fields and Tenements? but if the borrower do ſuffer loſs by ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected accidents, Charity will, that the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:107146:99"/>Creditor favour him, at leaſt, in the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, which is equivalent to the fetters lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Rent, and it is well if the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal be not hereby hazarded; whereas the Field and Land remain after the floud is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, and the Enemies withdrawn.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But are there no hazards that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant runs in what he rents? are there no droughts and flouds, no blaſts and mildews, no in breakings of Cattle, that may in part fruſtrate his hopes, and render his labour fruitleſs? here then the Landlord takes certain gains for that which is hazardable, which we have heard before declared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful in the lender.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſuppoſe a Caſe: A Farmer that rents a Tenement for years, having money of his own, only it is out in other hands, and cannot get it in to ſupply his preſent occaſions: he therefore borrows of his neighbour a hundred pounds: therewith he ſtocks the Tenement, and Tills the Ground, thus the money is laid out on Cattle, Corn and Tilling: but there-after there happens a Murrain amongſt his Cattle, a Drought eats up his Corn, or the Meldew cankers it: what reaſon is there the Landlord ſhould have his full Rent, but the lender muſt take his part in the loſs; ſeeing the failure was rather on the Tenements part, than the loan, which did the work it was deſigned for?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:107146:100"/> 4. For a cloſe to this Queſtion, let it be conſidered, Whether in the paying of <hi>Intereſt</hi> (by him held lawful) ſome of the objected inconveniences will not take place: for whether the borrower gain or loſe, he muſt (according to Mr. <hi>B.</hi>) in reaſon, make up the others loſs ſuſtained: And this may amount to more than the Uſe-money preſcribed by Law.<note place="margin">p. 56.</note> 
               <hi>For Intereſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is to be rated and proportioned, not according to the gain or benefit which the borrower hath reaped by the employment of the money; but according to the hinderance or loſs which the Creditor ſuſtaineth through the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers default.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Q. <hi>Whether <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury be againſt Equity, Conſcience and Reaſon?</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Equitableneſs hereof will appear from Gratitude on the borrowers part; from his conſent, promiſe, power to give, and the inequality of the contrary.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some Uſury, and that which I plead for, is grounded in gratitude: he that hath recived anothers money, and gained, and increaſed his Eſtate, or prevented damages thereby, is by humanity bound to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and to make due returns to the party by whom he hath profited.

            </p>
            <p>This liberal Uſury may, with a good Conſcience, be given and taken from an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and willing giver, Mr. <hi>B.</hi> conſenting,<note place="margin">p. 54.</note>

            <p>
               <hi>Reply:</hi> Is not this Over-plus paid upon the account of the loan? and may not the Creditor receive and expect it too upon the ſame account? or on what other account ſhould he receive it? As for the Compact it hath been anſwered already.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is alſo Conſent on both ſides, for a ground-work to the Equity of this Contract. Theft is the Uſurpation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Goods, without the conſent of the owner, and therefore Uſury cannot be Theft, as they plead: True, if there were force uſed by the Creditor to bring the borrower to ſuch a Compact, there had been Oppreſſion and unlawful dealing: but not ſo,<note place="margin">p. 55.</note> where it is his own voluntary act, and there is <hi>no injury done to one willing,</hi> according to the received <hi>Maxime,</hi> the which is by him pleaded, when it ſerves his turn.</p>
            <p>But they deny this free conſent in our Caſe: <hi>He being conſtrained by thy crueltie ſo to do,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 48.</note> ſaith <hi>Mr.</hi> B. <hi>being forced, he borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> ſaith <hi>Mr.</hi> J.<note place="margin">p. 57.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Let it be ſtill remembred, we are not ſpeaking of ſuch as borrow for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural neceſſity, or to keep themſelves from ſtarving: but of other borrowers that deſign Trade, gain, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how are ſuch compelled
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:107146:101"/>or forced? or doth the force ariſe from the lender?</p>
            <p>I conſult <hi>Seneca: Firſt of all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Contro. 3. l. 6.</note> 
               <hi>it is not force, where any thing is undergone for the diſpatching of a buſineſs, but only reaſon: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I cannot have a houſe unleſs I buy this: no other houſe is to be ſold: the ſeller ſeeth his time, and urgeth it: yet you ſhall not make void this bargain; otherwiſe Cavillation would prove endleſs. Another will ſay, there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity laid on me: a neceſſity laid on thee? how ſo? firſt thou couldſt have been without it, and again, thy needs might have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied another way, thou mightſt have ſtayed till another opportunity: couldſt thou not have been ſupplied otherwiſe, ſo much the more art thou engaged to me? but if there be force and neceſſity in the thing, then are the matters tranſacted, by force and neceſſity made void, if the force and neceſſity were impoſed by the Covenanter. It nothing concerns me, whether thou be forc'd, if thou be not forc'd by me: it ought to be my fault, that it ſhould be my puniſhment.</hi> Thus <hi>Seneca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall not doubt to ſay, there be not a few that pay Uſe, that freely and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily do it; and if left to their own free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would not do otherwiſe, I mean, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuppoſition of borrowing. In theſe there is a free conſent, and in others there is a ſecondary or interpretative willingneſs.<note place="margin">De Jure. c. 17 §. 18.</note> 
               <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary</hi> (ſaith <hi>Crotius</hi>) <hi>taking its ariſe
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:107146:102"/>from voluntary, is in Morals accounted for voluntary.</hi> 'Tis like, ſome would not pay Uſe, could they have the money <hi>gratis:</hi> and probably, would be unwilling to part with the Principal too, on the ſame terms; and he that buys, would keep his money, if he could obtain the Commodity for nought: yet here is a ſufficiency of will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs for transferring of a right, for here is conſent.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the Compact for lending, there is not only a private, but a publick conſent too; I mean, the National Law. Of both which Conſents,<note place="margin">De Jure. p. 541.</note> 
               <hi>Grotius</hi> writes thus: <hi>For as from our private conſent, there accrues, not only an outward, but alſo an inward right over our Goods; ſo alſo from a certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent, which, in effect, contains in it the conſent of every ſingle perſon, in which ſence, the Law of the Commonwealth, is called the Compact of the Common-wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Let us ſee farther, whether the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower have not a power to pay this Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus, or to make over the right thereof to the lender? I ſpeak of Civil Power or Right. This I prove, for if he have ſuch a power to give it freely, he hath a power to transfer it upon Compact: or let it be thought what is wanting here to this right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful power.</p>
            <p>Saith <hi>Grotius:</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 149.</note> 
               <hi>The principle, both here, and in other human acts, where-from a right
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:107146:102"/>doth ariſe, is that right, which we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted a moral faculty, together with a ſufficient will.</hi> Of the conſent of the will, I ſpake but now. Take then what this Learned Author adjoyns, of the definition of Propriety, <hi>which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is this, when the right of alienating is in our power; there are two things to be noted, the one in the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the other in the receiver: — In the one there is the ſame reaſon for aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and promiſing by the Law of Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of which laſt, I come now to ſpeak.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Equity of this Contract of Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is founded in promiſe or fidelity: the receiver of the money becomes debtor by promiſe; and it was ever the part of an honeſt man to make good his promiſe, where it is in his power to perform it. Saith the Author laſt mentioned, Tully <hi>in his Offices gave ſo great force to promiſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 220.</note> 
               <hi>that he calls Faithfulneſs the foundation of Juſtice.</hi> Again, <hi>All that have come to the uſe of reaſon, are capable of a right from a promiſe. — from this fellowſhip of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſpeech ariſeth that obligation from promiſe, whereof we have ſpoken. — a promiſe by it ſelf confers a new right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Author <hi>Of the Whole Duty of Man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 237.</note> writes thus: <hi>As for the other ſort of debts, that which is brought upon a man by his own voluntary promiſe, that alſo cannot without great injuſtice be withholden, for it is now the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:107146:103"/>mans right, and then 'tis no matter by what means it came to be ſo: therefore we ſee</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid <hi>makes it part of the deſcription of a juſt man,</hi> Pſal. 15.4. <hi>that he keeps his promiſes, yea, though they were made to his own diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</hi>

               <hi>Religiouſly keep all Promiſes and Covenants, though made to your diſadvantage, though afterwards you perceive you might have been better; and let not any precedent act of yours, be altered by any after-accident: let nothing make you break your promiſe, unleſs it be unlawful or impoſſible,</hi> i. e. <hi>either out of your Natural, or out of your Civil power, your ſelf being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of another, or that it be intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably inconvenient to your ſelf, and of no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to another; or that you have leave expreſſed, or reaſonably preſumed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The Equity of this Contract, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the inequality of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) It is unequal, that the Iender ſhould receive leſs than he delivered.</item>
               <item>(2.) It is unequal that one man ſhould grow rich, to anothers damage, by whom he is enriched.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. It is unequal that the lender ſhould receive back, leſs than the borrower re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him: but ſo it is, if nothing but the Principal be reſtored; for the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:107146:103"/>beſides this, received a right and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to uſe and make the beſt advantage of what was another mans: This is more than the Creditor can be ſaid to receive back, having back the Principal only, he receiveth but what was his own.</p>
            <p>The Anti Uſurers argue on the other hand, that Uſury is unjuſt, becauſe leſs is given, more is received: to which Object.<note place="margin">p. 675.</note> 
               <hi>Spanhemius</hi> thus replys. 3. <hi>It is doubtful in ſaying,</hi> leſs is given, more is received: <hi>for there is reſpect had either of the money de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered only, or there is alſo reſpect had to the undue office performed by the Creditor, the parting from his right which he had to the money, and the privation of the money thus lent for a time: In the former reſpect, it is certain, that leſs is given, more received; not ſo in the latter, ſeeing the Principal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd, anſwers to the Principal lent; the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verplus, as a juſt recompence, anſwers to the undue office, the parting from our right, the privation of the money, and other things of like nature. Yea, this ſame Argument may be turned againſt them, and ſaid, in ſuch a Contract the Debtor receives more than he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers back, ſeeing that he receives not only the Inſtrument, but alſo the advantage of greatly increaſing his own profits from him, to whom he pays a ſmall Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is unequal, that one man ſhould
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:107146:104"/>grow rich to anothers damage: but ſo it is in many caſes, where the borrower hath all the gain, procured by anothers money, and the Creditor that lent it hath none.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>Love</hi> anſwers the ſame objection.<note place="margin">Chriſt. Direct. p. 81.</note> 
               <hi>Then, I conceive it no breach of equity in trading, to take the more for a Commodity, If the Man that buys it requires time for the payment of it, than if he paid ready money, and my reaſon is this, becauſe the parting with a Commodity without money, is a damage and hinderance to the ſeller, and therefore he may lawfully take more, as in</hi> Lev. 25.14, 15. <hi>ſays God there;</hi> If thou buyeſt ought of thy Neighbour, or ſelleſt ought to thy Neighbour, you ſhall not oppreſs one another; but according to the multitude of years thou ſhalt increaſe the price thereof, and according to the fewneſs of years, thou ſhalt diminiſh the price thereof. <hi>The Caſe is here the ſame,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I might here examine Mr. <hi>B</hi>'s conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon this Queſtion: As 1. <hi>Though any may not ſell the dearer for time given, yet to bring the buyer to an equal price, he may ſell the dearer on that account as to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or according to the buyers apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi> 2. He grants there may be other reaſons (beſide forbearance) why the ſeller, granting time, may ſell the dearer.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:107146:108"/>As 1. When he knows that the value of the thing will be more at the day of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than at the day of ſale: 2. If the thing which he ſelleth have fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful uſe. — 3. When the price is detained beyond the time appointed. — Theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions may be retorted upon himſelf; but, I deſignedly avoid prolixity.</p>
            <p>Q. 6. <hi>Whether all Lending ought to be free,</hi>

               <hi>and a work of pure Charity,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This is commonly aſſerted by Mr. <hi>B. Lending was not (ſaith he) Ordained to be a Contract of negotiation; but an act of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Liberality wherein the Lender ſhould not reſpect his own gain, but the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers good,</hi> Luke 6.35.</p>

            <p n="2">2. It is granted on all hands, there is a lending that ought to be free; which yet is not to be taken abſolutely, univerſally, and without limitations: Ability is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the perſon lending, and neceſſity in the perſon borrowing. It is the Cauſe of the poor that our Saviour is here plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; to theſe God and Nature require a free lending.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:107146:108"/> 3. Where a man is not bound <hi>to Lend,</hi> he is not bound <hi>to lend freely;</hi> but to ſuch as are wealthy, and it may be richer than our ſelves, we are not bound to lend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not bound to Lend freely. <hi>There is a Lending of due, and a Lending of Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Perkins:</hi> It cannot be that Lending ſhould be due unto all. And it were but a jejune Interpretation of our Saviour's Injunction to underſtand it thus: <hi>Whenſoever you lend, ſee that your Lending be free:</hi> But rather thus; whenſoever you meet with objects of pity, ſome of my members that ſtand in need of your relief and helping hand, according to their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and your abilities, ſtretch forth your hand by giving or free Lending to them; though they be unable to requite you in the like kind.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His Interpretation of <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.19. would make it our duty to lend to all, and that freely: <hi>Thou ſhalt not lend upon uſury to thy Brother: ſay they, He is thy Brother whether poor or rich:</hi> adjoyn hereto then <hi>Ainſworths</hi> Commentary: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition the contrary is Commanded, thou ſhalt lend:</hi> what can follow from theſe premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſave this Concluſion: <hi>Thou ſhalt lend freely to poor and rich for both is thy Brother?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. We muſt not admit that which would injoyn us to ſhew the like Charity to rich and poor: but to require free Lending to
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:107146:109"/>rich and poor alike would do ſo. We read, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.16. <hi>He that oppreſſeth the poor to increaſe his riches, and he that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to the rich, ſhall ſurely come to pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Our Saviour injoyns a Lending to thoſe from whom we may not expect any thing again (according to our Antagoniſts ſenſe) but if we lend to the rich, and ſuch as trade and get gain, we may look for ſomething again: we may look for the principal again,<note place="margin">p. 31.</note> and for the like kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from them another time, as Mr. <hi>B.</hi> confeſſeth: and therefore this cannot be the Lending, that is here meant.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Though Acts of Juſtice and Charity are not contrary; yet they are of a diſtinct nature, and ought not to be confounded: for it is one thing to ſell, another thing to give or lend freely:<note place="margin">De benef. l. 6. c. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, <hi>Some one ſells me bread-corn; I cannot live unleſs I buy it: but I owe not my life becauſe I have bought: — What I have bought I am not beholding to any for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If in all Caſes, and to all Perſons we were tyed up to uſe acts of pure charity, there would be no room left for Acts of Juſtice, ſuch as buying and ſelling; for giving and free lending would ſwallow up all the former Acts.</p>
            <p>Reaſons againſt which are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:107146:109"/> 1. If any man were tyed up to Acts of Charity, and were not free to uſe Acts of Juſtice in Contracts, then the Fountain of his Charity would ſoon be drawn dry: for then he would be ſtill laying out, but not taking in: And no one man is able to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the Cravings and Expectations of all neceſſitous perſons, much leſs of all ſuch as would borrow freely. Pertinent is the Diſcourſe of <hi>Cicero;</hi>
               <note place="margin">De off. l. 1. p. 23.</note> 
               <hi>But becauſe the abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of each one are but ſmall, but the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thoſe that want theſe things is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, Common Liberality must be referred to that end of</hi> Ennius; That nevertheleſs there may be light to himſelf; <hi>that there may be a ſufficiency, whereby we may be free to our own Relations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This is the next reaſon: Charity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns us no ſuch thing whereby we ſhould be cruel to our ſelves or Relations: though we are to be kind to others, yet not ſo as to be unkind to our ſelves: we are to love others as our ſelves; not above or better than our ſelves.<note place="margin">Of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, part. 3. p. 325.</note> Even Mr. <hi>Capell</hi> himſelf will joyn with us herein: I <hi>ſpeak</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of ſuch as are able; for we may not ſtretch beyond our ſtaple and ſpoyl all: I muſt not make my ſelf poor, to keep another from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poor, throw my ſelf into the ſame degree of need, to help another in and againſt his need.

               <hi>It follows; Give to him that asketh of thee, and from one that would borrow of thee turn not thou away. If you urge this in</hi> Infinitum, <hi>nothing is more harſh.

            <p>To the ſame purpoſe, he quotes <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaying, <hi>I will give to one in want, but ſo that I may not want my ſelf: I will help one like to periſh, but ſo that I may not periſh my ſelf.</hi>

               <hi>Nothing is liberal which is not alſo juſt. There was another place of caution, that our bounty ſhould not be greater, than the ability; for that they who will be more liberal than their Eſtate will allow, offend firſt in this, that they are injurious to their near Relations: for what ſupplies it was more meet ſhould be afforded, and left to theſe, they ſpend upon Strangers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe Inconveniencies and unequal dealings mentioned, would follow from free Lending in ſeveral Caſes, and expreſly where the Lender is poorer than the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower, as it frequently falls out: And where Widdows and Orphans are the Lenders, that have nothing elſe to ſubſiſt on: to teach in this caſe, that they may not with a good Conſcience take any thing above the principal, would prove uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and oppreſſive: foraſmuch as there is no ſhew of reaſon that others ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe their Eſtate by the dammage of ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p>As to Orphans the Jews, as ſtrict as they are againſt Uſury amongſt themſelves, yet there will allow Uſury to be taken for ſuch, as <hi>Hornbeck</hi> ſhews out of <hi>Maimondes.</hi>

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:107146:111"/>if loſs, take that wholly to thy ſelf: for this is the duſt of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury; and this duſt is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited unleſs it be by poſitive Law, wherein there is nothing determined of the Goods of Orphans.</hi>

            <p n="7">7. Lending upon Uſe, may be not only juſt, but charitable too; or, if you will, an act of kindneſs. As when a man has both money by him, and an opportunity to buy a good purchaſe; he Lends this money (for moderate gain) to another to that end that he may buy this Purchaſe: this cannot be denied to be an act of kindneſs. <hi>Seneca</hi> writes thus: <hi>If any one have profited us for his own ſake, are we any thing obliged to him, thou wilt ſay? — It is much to the purpoſe, whether any does us a good turn for his own ſake, or for ours, or for his own and ours too.</hi>

            <p n="8">8. And Laſtly, whereas Mr. <hi>B.</hi> affirms, that all lending ought to be free, and this not only by the written Law of God, but by the <hi>Light of Nature;</hi> ſuch as was by the Heathen themſelves diſcerned. I <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi> They are very quick-ſighted that can read this written in Natures Law, <hi>that all loan ought to be free:</hi> or that, if I lend to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:107146:111"/>another, whoſe wants, all conſidered, are leſs than mine, I muſt take no profit upon the account of this loan; but the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er muſt go away with all the gains. Nature truly holds her ballances more equally than this comes to.</p>
            <p>Q. 7. <hi>Whether need be always to be ſupo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the borrower to make his borrowing lawful?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this mind is Mr. <hi>B.</hi> ſaying: <hi>He that would borrow, ſhould have need to borrow, for a needleſs deſire is unlawful.</hi> Again <hi>The Holy Ghoſt in the borrower preſuppoſeth need.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 24.</note> I am not concerned to queſtion the truth of this; but rather cloſe with it ſo far,<note place="margin">p. 40.</note> That none have a right to our free lending, but ſuch as borrow out of need or neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or thoſe to whom we are bound by the common bonds of humanity to extend our Charity.</p>
            <p>We have all this while been inquiring concerning the lenders duty: I ſhall now take occaſion from the queſtion propoſed, to ſpeak ſomewhat to that of the borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: that things may be weighed on both ſides with equal ballances. And to that end ſhall lay down theſe following Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:107146:112"/> 1. A three-fold need may be ſuppoſed on the borrowers part; (for I believe none borrows, but from ſome need, either real or conceited; either of Natures, or their own making.) Theſe needs I find in <hi>Seneca</hi> ſtated to my hands.<note place="margin">De ben. l. 1. c. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Of thoſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which are neceſſary, ſome obtain the firſt place, without which we cannot live: ſome the ſecond place, without which we ought not: ſome the third, without which we will not.</hi> Or take them thus: There is the need of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, of conveniency, of wantonneſs, and ſome there are that borrow out of all theſe needs, taking them ſeverally.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such as borrow out of meer neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they may live, and ſtave off hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and nakedneſs, to them lending muſt be free, otherwiſe it will be griping. And</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) This need was ſuppoſed in the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed God pleaded for, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.36. <hi>Deut.</hi> 15.7, 8.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The Heathen that were ſo ſtrict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Uſury, were of that mind, that none ought to borrow, but out of this abſolute neceſſity: which being true, the expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theſe againſt Uſury, will but little advantage the Cauſe of Anti-Uſurers, or befriend our common borrowers, that think wrong done them, if the loan come not free unto them.<note place="margin">p. 284.</note> Saith <hi>Rivet, The Bp. of</hi> Wincheſter <hi>himſelf at length confeſſeth,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:107146:112"/>that the ſame thing pleaſed</hi> Moſes <hi>which did</hi> Plato, <hi>that none ſhould demand water of his neighbour, until he had digged in his own Ground, even down as far as the Chalke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I find in <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mor. Part. 2. p. 471.</note> both interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and applied to our matter in hand. Plato <hi>in his Laws</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſuffers not neighbours to partake of anothers water, till they had digged at home in their own ſoyl, as far as the Clay, and find it void of water. He means that ſuch have ſome part of other mens Goods, (the Law of Poverty pleading for them) that cannot get ſome of their own. Is it not evident, that Law belongs to money-matters, ſo that men ſhould not borrow from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, nor go unto others fountains, till they have ranſack'd their ſtore at home, and as it were collected by drops what may ſupply their uſe and neceſſity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Is not this the need intended by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 4.28?</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is a need of Conveniency: When men would have ſomewhat, that they can live without; but yet cannot well want, without ſome diſconvenience to their Trade, or obſtacle to their gain, or more comfortable ſubſiſtence: may men lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly borrow, being under this need? I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they may:<note place="margin">p. 40.</note> And I find Mr. <hi>B.</hi> incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this way, ſaying. <hi>But if thy wealthy friend have ſome preſent, occaſional need, (as
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:107146:113"/>the richeſt may have) then if thou canst ſpare it, lend in kindneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Mr. <hi>B.</hi> then ſaith, if we lend to ſuch, we ought to lend free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even to the wealthieſt and richeſt men, if they be under ſuch occaſional needs: but others, upon grounds forementioned, ſay otherwiſe: for why ſhould one be bound to run himſelf into an inconvenience to free another out of one?</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a need of wantonneſs.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Saith <hi>Plutarch: When men being ſet on by Luxury,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ut ſupra.</note> 
               <hi>effeminateneſs and Prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, do not uſe their own, but take up great ſums upon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury from others, being compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by no neceſſity.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 30.</note> Mr <hi>B.</hi> makes mention too of the cove our deſire and pride of bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) Is it lawful for ſuch to borrow? not ſurely to ſeed their luſts, luxury, pride or oppreſſion of others; this is ſoon accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſo on all ſides.<note place="margin">part. 3. §. 7. p. 327.</note> Mr. <hi>Capel</hi> makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all three neceſſities, and excludes the laſt from the priviledge of borrowing: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the queſtion, <hi>Why, and to whom muſt we give? To all, but chiefly to the poor, ſuch as are in need; and need in a caſe, or in ſome particular point, may befal a rich man: but when men make their own need, and through pride or folly, do occaſion their own occaſions and wants; and do deſire us that we ſhould give or lend; here we are to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:107146:113"/>withhold and not feed the luſts or humors of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3.) But ſuppoſe it be unknown to the lenders, that others borrow on theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful deſigns; ought not ſuch as theſe, upon diſcovery pay Uſe? or may not the Creditor, with a good Conſcience, of ſuch, take ſomewhat above the Principal? No, not according to their Principles; all gain taken on any ſuch ſcore being a ſin againſt Nature, as they ſay; but I am confident, in this caſe, not again Juſtice or Charity, it being againſt both, that ſuch ſhould have poorer Mens Eſtates in their hands <hi>gratis,</hi> whiles they are ſomenting their own luſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There be ſome that hold it unlawful, not only to take, but alſo to pay Uſe, or give a gratuity.<note place="margin">Annot. in Ex. 22.25.</note> 
               <hi>Ainſworth</hi> cites <hi>Maimonides</hi> that Learned Rabbi to this effect: only he intends it for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, whereto Rabbins generally thought the Law of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury peculiar.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As it is unlawful</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to lend; ſo it is unlawful to borrow upon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury — It is unlawful to take uſe before or after: As one intending to borrow of a man, ſends him a gift, to the end, that be may lend unto him: this is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury before hand: Or he hath borrowed of a man, and paid him again, and ſends him a gift for his Money, which he had of him for nought, this is after-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:107146:114"/>borroweth of his neighbor, and was not wont in former time to ſalute him firſt, it is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for him to ſalute him firſt: — for it is written</hi> Uſury of any word or thing: <hi>likewiſe it is unlawful to the borrower to learn the lender to read, — all the while the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is in his hand, if he were not wont to do ſo before,</hi> &amp;c. ſtrange it is that Eagles ſhould thus catch Flies, and great Rabbies learnedly diſcourſe of trifles. If Mr. <hi>J.</hi> had hit upon theſe paſſages, they would have befriended him in the confirmation of that conceit, that it is not lawful to take a mite or Cup of cold water above the Principal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> There may be, and commonly is, oppreſſion in the borrower, as well as the lender: This happens, when men uſe deceits to finger anothers money; pretend ability, when there is none, promiſe repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when they intend it not, wearying out the Creditors with their denyals or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, and many other ways ſeeking his da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and trouble: theſe things, I am ſure, ought not to be, though the evil and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs thereof be but little laid to heart by many borrowers.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore ſay ſomething for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to practices of this nature.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here is a plain violation of truth and faithfulneſs, which is the bond of humane ſocieties, and pillar of Juſtice: a good man is one <hi>that ſweareth to his hurt,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. It is a direct and open violation of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, that calls upon men to give every one his due, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Ow no man any thing.</hi> the Lord requires, that men ſhould labour, that they may eat their own bread, and not live by the ſweat of other mens Brows, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.8, 12. whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.28. <hi>Let him that ſtole, ſteal no more: Estius</hi> thereon, Comments thus: <hi>To Steal is here largely put for to deceive, or unjuſtly to take away, or detain that which is anothers. — He here includes reſtitution: for he that doth not reſtore when he can, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveres in Theft,</hi> i. e. <hi>in the voluntary with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of anothers Goods,</hi> So Prov. 3.27. <hi>Withhold not good from them to whom it is due,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p n="5">5. As a Comment on thoſe fore-cited Scriptures, I ſhall recite what is written by the Judicious Author <hi>Of the Whole Duty of Man.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 235.</note> 
               <hi>The ſecond ſort of this injuſtice is Theft, and of that alſo there are two kinds; the one the withholding what we ſhould pay, and the other, taking from our neighbor what is already in his poſſeſſion. Of the firſt ſort, is the not paying of Debts, whether ſuch as we have borrowed, or ſuch as by our own voluntary promiſe are become our debts, for they are equally due to him that can lay either of theſe claims to them; and therefore, the withholding of either of them is a Theft, a keeping from my neighbour that which is his: yet the former of them is rather the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, for by that I take from him that which he once actually had (be it Money, or whatſoever elſe) and ſo make him worſe than I found him. This is a very great, and a very common injuſtice: Men can now adays, with as great confidence deny him that asks a Debt, as they do him that asks an Almes: Nay, many times 'tis matter of quarrel, for a man to demand his own; beſides the many attendances the Creditor is put to in purſuit of it, are yet, a further injury to him, by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting his time, and taking him off from other buſineſſes, and ſo he is made a loſer that way
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:107146:115"/>too: This is ſo great injuſtice, that I ſee not how a man can look upon any thing he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as his own right, whilſt he thus denys another his. It is the duty of every man in Debt, rather to ſtrip himſelf of all, and caſt himſelf again naked upon Gods Providence, than thus to feather his Nest with the ſpoils of his Neighbours. — But the ſure way for a man to ſecure himſelf from the guilt of this injuſtice, is never to borrow more than he knows he hath means to repay, unleſs it be of one, who knowing his diſability, is willing to run the hazard; otherwiſe, he commits this ſin at the very time of borrowing: for he takes that from his neighbor, upon promiſe of paying, which he knows he is never likely to reſtore to him, which is a flat robbery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As for the other ſort of Debts,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 237.</note> 
               <hi>that which is brought upon a man by his own voluntary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that alſo cannot, without great injuſtice; be withholden: for it is now the mans right, and then 'tis no matter by what means it came to be ſo: therefore we ſee</hi> David <hi>makes it part of the deſcription of a juſt man,</hi> Pſal. 15.4. <hi>that he keepeth his promiſes, yea, though they were made to his own diſadvantage.</hi>

               <hi>Lastly,</hi> I ſhall cloſe with the Son of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach,</hi> Eccleſ. 29.4, &amp;c. <hi>Many, when a thing was lent them, reckoned it to be found, and put them to trouble that helped them: till he hath
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:107146:116"/>received, he will kiſs a mans hand: and for his neighbors money, he will ſpeak ſubmisſly; but when he ſhould repay, he will prolong the time, and return words of grief, and complain of the time: if he prevail, he ſhall hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the half, and he will count as if he had found it: if not, he hath deprived him of his money, and he hath gotten him an enemy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe: he payeth him with Curſings and Railings; and for honour, he will pay him diſgrace. Many men have therefore refuſed to lend for other mens ill dealing, fearing to be defrauded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee, that if theſe laſt cited Authors ſpeak true, ſuppoſe Uſurers be Thieves, (as is commonly aſſerted) yet there be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny borrowers that may be enrolled with them, and bear part of the denomination: though this will not juſtifie the faulty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong either ſort; but it becomes both the one and the other, to mind honeſty in their Dealings.</p>

                  </expan> Impoſitum alteri vos Exigitis.</hi> I know it paſſeth for currant, that the practice here reproved by <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was that of Uſury; Though there be not one word in the Original that expreſſeth <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> ſetting aſide the general term <hi>burden.</hi> And there being other Burdens they might have laid upon their Brethren beſide Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) unleſs this muſt bear the burden of all Exactions and Oppreſſions whatſoever) and theſe appearing to be ſome different burdens from that; it will follow that the practices here blamed cannot be proved to have directly violated the law againſt uſury.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let them be examined apart.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt burden we meet with is, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>There were that ſaid, We, our Sons, our Daughters are many; therefore we take up Corn that we may eat and live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this Corn had been taken up by them under an Engagement to reſtore double, or any Increaſe, it had been Uſury by the Law forbidden, but this no way appears
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:107146:118"/>to be ſo: and in all likelyhood was not. For they returning newly from Captivity poor and needy, having a great charge of Children, and now working on a publick account; do deſire at leaſt their Corn be allowed them on a publick Account:<note place="margin">See Ezr. 3.7.</note> and for the future not to be forc't to pay, or enter promiſe to pay for the Corn taken up by them for a Livelyhood. Thus <hi>Diodate: Take up,</hi> i. e. <hi>whilſt we work for the publick good, let our food at leaſt be provided for, either by the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of rich men, or by ſome publick libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</hi> Thus <hi>Diodate:</hi> and the motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſonable, makes the interpretation ſeem as probable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next burden is mentioned, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>Some alſo there were that ſaid, we have mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged our Lands, Vineyards, and Houſes, that we might buy corn becauſe of the dearth.</hi> Neither can this be proved to be the ſin of Uſury, but ſome other oppreſſion. For the perſons to whom theſe Eſtates were morgaged, either gave for them an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value, or the full value; If the firſt be true, ſo that they wrought upon the neceſſities of this poor people, and gave them not the full value; this was the ſin of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, even of oppreſſion in buying and ſelling; which is by God prohibited in this particular of morgaging or ſelling E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.14, 17. But if they gave
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:107146:118"/>the full value for the Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This ſurely had been lawful at any other time, ſave ſuch as this; and the Law of redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eſtates thus morgaged ſuppoſeth it; <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.24, 25. And who would ſell Lands or Houſes, but men neceſſitous? And it ſeems from the hiſtory of <hi>Naboth,</hi> they might not chop and change Inheritances at pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third complaint we have <hi>v.</hi> 45. <hi>They borrowed Money to pay the Kings Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and that upon their Lands:</hi> Theſe 'tis like, being made over, or morgaged by ſecuring the money borrowed: and there was a further ground of Complaint; that hereupon they were neceſſitated to ſell their Sons and Daughters for Bondſlaves.</p>
            <p>This was oppreſſion contrary to another Law mentioned, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.39, &amp;c. <hi>They ſhall not be ſold as Bondmen,</hi> v. 42.</p>
            <p>The Aggravation of this oppreſſion we find, <hi>v.</hi> 8. Whereas <hi>Nehemiah</hi> with ſome others had juſt before ſhewn their pity and kindneſs to their Brethren, in Ranſoming them out of Captivity: Theſe preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſign to make their Market of them, by ſelling them again, or taking them for Bondſlaves to themſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Complaint in <hi>v.</hi> 7. hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect but unto the foregoing grievances; it being their complaint taken up and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged anew by <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in his contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:107146:119"/>with the Nobles. We read, 'tis true, <hi>ye exact <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury;</hi> but nearer to the Hebrew it is, <hi>ye exact a burden every one of his Brother;</hi> or, <hi>ye Exact a debt or Loan;</hi> ſo <hi>Buxtorf</hi> renders the word by <hi>Debitum, mutuum.</hi> And then it was not Money for uſe that that they exacted, but the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal; whereas they ſhould have forgiven their Brethren that were poor, and even brought to ſtarving: and for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſenſe makes what we read, <hi>Neh.</hi> 10.31.

            <p n="5">5. All the doubt then remains of what is written, <hi>v.</hi> 11. Where they are called on to <hi>reſtore the hundredth part of the money, — that they had Exacted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Hundredth part of Money, Corn, Wine and Oyl, thus exacted by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Governours, Mr. <hi>C.</hi> after others, takes for granted to be Uſury that they took, but cannot ſettle whether it were taken every Month, or once a Year only:
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:107146:119"/>
               <hi>i. e.</hi> Whether it were after the rate of one, or twelve in the Hundred. But I believe it was neither one nor other; but rather ſome other way of exaction than by Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and my reaſon of this conjecture I take from what the Governour himſelf ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>I likewiſe, and my Brethren, and my Servants, might exact of them Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Corn.</hi> Which way might he and his have exacted Money and Corn of their Brethren? I dare ſay, he meant it not by way of Uſury, which was expreſly againſt the Law: for this had been a frigid, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>june reaſon to diſwade from Uſury, to ſay, I and others might have done ſo as well as you; the thing in queſtion too being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Divine prohibition. Upon the whole it ſeems to me not an improbable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, that this hundredth part was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by them as <hi>Officers and Rulers</hi> among the people, for ſo they were, <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.1.</p>
            <p>The forbearanee of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> toward the people, you may ſee, <hi>v.</hi> 14.15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas other Governours before him, had been chargeable to the people, and had taken Bread and Wine, and Silver of them; and their Servants bare rule over them: In this <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was not chargeable to them; for neither he nor his Brethren did eat the Bread of the Governour, for the ſpace of 12. years: and it ſeems he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:107146:120"/>the other Rulers to have uſed the like forbearance towards this people, and not have exacted at this time that part of the Corn and Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that belonged to them. This I take to be the Genuine ſenſe of the place: The ſum of <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> diſwaſion being; I <hi>Pray let us leave off this burden,</hi> v. 10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thus I have endeavoured to clear, that it was not Uſury, but ſome other op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive burden they are here reproved for. But to my purpoſe it matters not much, whether it were this or that: for let it be granted, that the thing blamed was Uſury, and the caſe was not extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary: yet the condemnation of all Uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry amongſt Chriſtians cannot be hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">v. 2.</note> Theſe were poor, ſo acknowledged to be by Mr. <hi>C.</hi> himſelf: and the Hiſtory ſpeaks it ſufficiently (though Mr. <hi>Jel.</hi> would hence prove, it is not lawful to take uſe of the rich.) Now the Law was expreſs, they might not take uſe of the poor, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.25. Yea they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to relieve him when fallen into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, and not to lend him their money for Uſury, nor Victuals for increaſe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.35, 36, 37.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They exacted uſury of their <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, v.</hi> 7. I cannot be perſwaded they might have exacted Uſury of a Stranger
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:107146:120"/>that was poor, and borrowed to keep him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from ſtarving,<note place="margin">p. 267. Marg.</note> (though Mr. <hi>Capel</hi> ſaith <hi>the Jews might have put their money to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe to a poor Stranger, though not to a poor or rich Jew.</hi>) This was the <hi>Jews</hi> peculiar, they might not take Uſe of their Brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, thoſe of their own Nation whatever he were. The former being law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and charity, that injoyns acts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon humanity. This latter was a law Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, that intended acts of peculiar kindneſs, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.19, 20. They might lend upon Uſury to a Stranger, but not to a Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: though moſtly it was the poorer ſort among the <hi>Jews</hi> that borrowed. Hear Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſpeaking to the ſame effect: <hi>The Law doth urge it moſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 267.</note> 
               <hi>that it be not done to the poor</hi> Jews; <hi>was it not becauſe the</hi> Jews <hi>were then too noble and generous to go a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing, except it were the poorer ſort? what ſhould the Law then forbid that to be done by rich men, which moſt rich men never did?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The uſual ſhift here is to ſay,<note place="margin">p. 266, 267</note> that <hi>by Stranger, is meant the</hi> Canaanite, <hi>whom they were bound to kill.</hi> What? bound to kill him, and yet might lend him money? bound to have no ſociety with him, for fear of infecton, and yet might have Civil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with him? A thing incredible! this is an arguing that cuts its own Throat.</p>
            <pb n="232" facs="tcp:107146:121"/>
            <p> The <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves, with their Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Rabbies, always underſtood the Law, of a Stranger indefinitely,<note place="margin">In Luc. 6.35.</note> as <hi>Grotius</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts: And how could they underſtand it otherwiſe, when Stranger and Brother are oppoſed in the Text? was the <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> or <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> their brother? if not, then the <hi>Jews</hi> were not prohibited to lend to theſe upon Uſury.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>C. The Law I know permitted it to the</hi> Jews,<note place="margin">p. 266.</note> 
               <hi>to the Stranger; what of that? It follows the rather, that it is of it ſelf a ſin, becauſe permiſſion is of ſins, not of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. It is well known, there is a <hi>Medium</hi> between ſins and duties; things indifferent are neither ſins nor duties, which may come under an exception or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in Political Laws. <hi>Some permiſſion</hi> (ſaith <hi>Grotius</hi>) <hi>gives a right to do a thing,</hi> for thus he writes: <hi>We will ſpeak ſomething more distinctly of things permitted, For the permiſſion which is by Law (for that which is of the naked fact, and ſignifies the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the impediment belongs not to this place) is either full, which grants a full right to do a thing lawfully: or is leſs than full, which only grants impunity amongſt men, and a right that no man may lawfully hinder him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Is it credible, that God by a Law poſitively permitted ſin? or tolerated
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:107146:121"/>what is in itſelf ſinful, and againſt the very Law of Nature; even ſuch a ſin as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of all ſorts,<note place="margin">p. 267.</note> 
               <hi>viz. Poets, Orators, Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, Philoſophers, all cryed ſhame upon?</hi> a ſin that is in it ſelf Theſt, as bad as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery? would it conſiſt with Gods Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, thus to permit Adultery, Murder or Theſt? for either theſe would be ſin af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch permiſſion or not? if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſin after permiſſion granted, would it not prove a blemiſh to the Holineſs of Gods Law? but if theſe ceaſed to be ſin by the permiſſion, hereby an alteration would be made in the very Law of Nature, which will not be eaſily granted. <hi>Grotius</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">De Jure. p. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The Law of Nature is ſo unalterable, that it cannot be changed by God himſelf.</hi> Let them not tell us, of the ſpoiling the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> and killing the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites asking</hi> or <hi>borrowing</hi> being not in it ſelf unlawful (as they ſay Uſury is, and that it cannot be made good by any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) neither killing an enemy, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved death by his wickedneſs, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated alſo by ſufficient Authority, as they were in both theſe inſtances.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But what talk they of a permiſſion? this was more, even an allowance; for in the Original there is no difference in the manner of expreſſing, as there is in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles: which if ſo, why ſhould one
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:107146:122"/>be barely a permiſſion, when the other is a Command or Prohibition?</p>
            <p n="4">4. It ſhall be granted (if that will ſerve their turn) that to ſome Strangers they might not lend upon Uſury: but theſe are ſuch as are excepted by the Law it ſelf; and they were poor Strangers, and ſuch as were become Brethren in the Faith, as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> in his Appendix obſerves from <hi>Ainſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 291.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But that by Stranger, is meant the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Nations only,<note place="margin">Append. 290.</note> he would prove from hence, <hi>Becauſe the Jews ſtood generally bound to ſhew all mercy, eſpecially to common ſtrangers,</hi> Heb. 13.2. <hi>The Fatherleſs, the Widow and the Stranger, go hand in hand together in the Word of God; now <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no act of kindneſs and mercy, but rather the contrary,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. The <hi>Jews</hi> were to ſhew more kindneſs to thoſe of their own Nation, then to Strangers, as appears, beyond denyal, by many other Political Laws be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And though free lending were an act of kindneſs (as the borrower ſound) yet it hence follows not, that taking mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Uſe is in it ſelf an act of unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; acts of juſtice and equity coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween acts of Charity on the one hand, and acts of Oppreſſion on the other.</p>
            <pb n="235" facs="tcp:107146:122"/>
            <p> Mr. <hi>C. The moſt that can be ſaid is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 265.</note> 
               <hi>that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury-taker pays the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe willingly; and where a man parts with his money willingly, reſtitution is not of force.</hi> Judas <hi>might have retained the money, with the good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Prieſts, who gave it will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; yet he did reſtore it, and was bound unto it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. Theſe are but fair ſhews: the ground work here was rotten: a Pack of Knaves bargaining for the price of innocent bloud; the one ſide hiring the Betrayer, the other for filthy lucre actually betraying or ſelling his Maſter: the foundation in the other Contract is lawful, <hi>viz.</hi> the lending and borrowing of money.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the former Compact, the betraying of the Innocent had been abominable, and would have called for Repentance, if no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney had paſſed on that account: they will not ſay ſo of the latter Contract.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here the Chief Prieſts hired <hi>Judas</hi> to do miſchiefs: does the Creditor by the money he lends, or the borrower by the Uſe he pays, hire each other on this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Had the money been given <hi>Judas</hi> for any kindneſs or good ſervice done them, what had been herein blame-worthy? whereas the money the borrower pays, is returned upon ſuch account.</p>
            <pb n="236" facs="tcp:107146:123"/>
            <p> Mr. <hi>C. And were this good Divinity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>then a great deal of that which comes in by briberie and dicerie may be lawfullie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably kept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. The conſequence fails, what comes in by bribery indeed ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored: There are two things that difference the caſe.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Whereas Bribery is a reward ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the ſelling or perverting of Juſtice: Let it be remembred, that thoſe who are concerned in the adminiſtration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, have their reward or ſees ſixed and ſtated, to be payed them either out of the Publick, or by the partys concerned: now when ſuch take beyond and beſides ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, this is to be paid twice for the ſame office and ſervice: but is the Creditors caſe the ſame? is he otherwiſe rewarded for the kindneſs he ſhews in lending his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney?</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The next difference makes the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the arguing yet more apparent: for bribery is a gratuity or free gift; &amp; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſtowed on ſuch account, is ſinful both in the giver and taker: But a gratuity or free gift communicated by the borrower, is commonly acknowledged by themſelves to be lawful, and may be both ſafely given, and ſafely taken, though the borrower there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in have an eye to the kindneſs done him by the loan.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:107146:123"/>
[2.] As to the Argument from Dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ground-work is rotten, Dicery being generally held to be unlawful, becauſe a Lottery; and ſo not like to len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If Dicery were lawful, yet it were not commendable to venture at it more than the ſport or recreation is worth: No man is ſo Maſter of his money, as to caſt it away at hap-hazard; but where the gains and loſſes are ſmall, and recompenced by the ſport or recreation, I ſee not the neceſſity of reſtitution: Whereas, with Mr. <hi>Jel.</hi> and his Authors, the ſmalleſt gain, ſuch as a Cup of Cold Water or a Mite, were unlawful to be taken upon the account of money lent, and then I think, upon the ſuppoſal of ſuch receits reſtitution muſt be made.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>C. Then I ſay,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>that though it be not againſt the will of the borrower, that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer ſhould keep the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, yet it ſhould be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. There are (ſaith <hi>Grotius</hi>) two things required to the transferring of a right, and theſe are <hi>will</hi> and <hi>power:</hi> here it is ſuppoſed that the borrower is willing to pay this Uſe, what is then wanting? a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful power? if ſo, doth either the Law of God or Man forbid it?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:107146:124"/> 2. The borrower may give a gratuity; yea and ought to be thankful, and return kindneſs for kindneſs, if able, what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders then? may he not give it in caſe the Creditor expects it? or becauſe of the Compact paſt, whereby he is bound to give it? but theſe bonds he freely and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly enter'd into, and <hi>volenti non fit inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>B.</hi> And if he may give it freely without a Compact, why may he not give when he is under a double obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, that of kindneſs and promiſe? theſe are ſuch niceties as will puzzle the Conſciences of the plain and honeſt-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if not of wiſer and more diſcerning perſons, how to put a difference between them.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. That is, in other terms, the borrower cannot tell how to get Money for to buy a bargain, ſtop a gap, or uſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing with, for nothing: if he could, 'tis likely, he would never pay Uſe. And at the ſame rate, are there not many that borrow, that would detain the Principal, if they knew how to do it, or if left to the choice of their wills? that do as unwillingly refund the Money lent them, as the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veler parts with his Purſe to the Thief? <hi>The Wicked borroweth, and payeth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi>

Is not here as great a willingneſs, as in other Contracts: Many would not buy, if they could haue for nothing; though I know <hi>Abraham</hi> was otherwiſe minded, and <hi>David</hi> too. Many men that take pains for livelihood, would not, if they could tell how to help it: and ſo, 'tis beyond doubt, they would not pay Uſe for what they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, if they knew how to have their wants ſupplied otherwiſe: But obſerve, there is no violence or conſtraint offered the mans will or perſon: here is no fraud or deceit uſed to blind the underſtanding and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to work the will to a compliance. If a wealthy borrower like not the terms, though within the compaſs of moderation and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Law, he may let the loan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, there is no wrong done: Neither the Law of God or Man lays an engagement upon another to lend to him freely. If he agrees to the terms propoſed, here is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and as much willingneſs, as uſeth to be in the buyer, who not ſeldom is with much ado brought up to the ſellers price. All the doubt then remaineth, whether the Debtor have a ſufficient power to transfer his right to the Over-plus he pays: and why not? ſeeing he may give a gratuity, and may lend ſo much another time to his friend, and there is no Law forbidding him: whereas there was the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture forbidding <hi>Cato</hi> to lend his Wife to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,

               <hi>was demoliſh'd; and with that both the kind and hope of the Commonwealth fell; for neither in the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>is any term predefined: neither Chriſt or his Apoſtles any where ſpeak of the ceſſation of that Law, ſave as far as it might ſeem to be comprehended in the ruine of the Commonwealth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>Politieals</hi> then were not out of date in Chriſt's time, as Mr. <hi>C.</hi> would perſwade us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I am very ſecure (upon reaſons for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly given) that our Saviour here never intended the condemnation of all Uſury. And Mr. <hi>Bolt.</hi>

Whence I gather, that in his ſenſe, <hi>Lend, hoping for nothing again,</hi> is not to be underſtood without limitation: For 1. In many Caſes it is lawful to receive the principal again. 2.

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:107146:128"/>need truly require it, we will grant, that much leſs, in the like Caſe may an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verplus be received. 3. Our Saviours intent (according to him) being to take men off from contenting themſelves with doing what the ſinners then did; and what they did was a lending to thoſe that would beſriend them another time with the like kindneſs; It neceſſarily follows, that this Lending, hoping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was not abſolutely condemned by our Saviour, but only with reſpect to the poor and needy. 4.

            <p>Now here in the Caſe of Uſury the Law of man interpoſes, and the conſent of the Borrower; and ſomewhat valuable on the Lenders part: for I cannot be perſwaded but that the Loan of money is worth mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.

               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. I doubt his proof is lame: the more of Traders, the cheaper moſtly are Commodities. If none ſhould be Traders, but ſuch as are monied men, then ſuch Traders would be fewer, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the Trade being in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the hands of few, Commodities would be dearer and ſcarcer than they are, both upon the account of the paucity of ſellers, and their indifferency in parting with the Commodity, unleſs the buyer comes up to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. This is apparent if applied to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign wares: for the bringing in whereof, I do not know that they that have money are bound to Lend to the Merchants free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they might ſell the cheaper: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I be perſwaded, that if they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed freely, they would ſell much the cheaper; but the gains would remain in their own Coffers, and the poor pay as dear as before: and would not things bear the ſame price, and come to the ſame Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, provided the Lender entred fellowſhip, and bare a ſhare both in the loſſes and gains?</p>
            <p n="2">2. All Commodities ſold, are either ſuch as are neceſſary, or ſuch as are only convenient or ſuperfluous: the meaſure in the former commonly is ſcarcity, the meaſure of worth in the latter is moſtly fancy, or the will of man. So I learn
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:107146:130"/>from <hi>Grotius, The moſt natural meaſure of every thing, What it is worth is ſcarcity,</hi>

               <hi>As</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>rightly ſhews: but this is not the only meaſure; for the will of man which is the Lord over things, deſires many things more than are neceſſary.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Append. p. 291.</note> 
               <hi>but rather the contrary; it cannot but follow, that the permiſſion to lend upon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe to the Stranger, muſt not be meant of ordinary Strangers, to whom they were to ſhew all kindneſs and compaſſion, but the Strangers of thoſe curſed Nations, whom they were bound to bite and eat out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. This hath been anſwered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. It is a ſign men are hard put to it, when they make uſe of ſuch weak ſhifts and evaſions; for ſo I muſt call it, there being ſo little footing for it in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (from whence alone they can take it) And why ſhould they diſtinguiſh where Scripture diſtinguiſheth not, nor gives any ground towards it; but rather the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the enquiry, whether Lending upon uſe be a favour or no? I ſay that free lending was a greater favour to the borrowers: and this was requiſite for the Jewiſh Commonwealth and Polity; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they would have loſt the benefit of ſome other political Laws; ſuch as were the forgiving of debts every ſeventh,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:107146:131"/>and the releaſing of Morgages every Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth year. But for Commonwealths ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Traffick, I doubt not to ſay that Lending on uſe is beneficial, yea neceſſary: that money being hereby imployed this way, that would otherwiſe be diverted (and that without wrong to any man) to other uſes; or elſe be hoarded up. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans concernments leading this way, beſides the ordinary ingratitude, unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and undue delay on the part of moſt Borrowers.</p>

Neither is that true; that the Jews were to ſhew <hi>all kindneſs</hi> to ordinary Strangers: kindneſs indeed they were to ſhew: this Common humanity bound them to, if there had been no expreſs Law of God in Scripture requiring it: And hereupon I advance, and ſay, that lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon uſe was conſiſtent with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon kindneſs, being they might thus lend upon uſe to a Stranger, to whom yet they were injoyned to ſhew kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But I am yet to ſeek that they were to ſhew <hi>all kindneſs</hi> to Strangers, whether you underſtand it of kinds or degrees; It is apparent there were ſeveral kinds and degrees of kindneſs they were to ſhew toward their own Nation, the which they were not bound to ſhew to others: this is evident from ſeveral Laws given
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:107146:131"/>that Nation, as before hinted, and amongſt the reſt this of Uſury.</p>
            <p>Whereas he ſaith, <hi>That <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury is no act of kindneſs and mercy, but rather the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> This needs a little examining before it have a let paſs. Let it be ſtill remembred, there is a <hi>Medium</hi> between acts of Mercy or pure Charity and uncharitableneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> Acts of Juſtice. Thus buying and ſelling, which are acts of Juſtice, are not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acts of Charity. <hi>One ſells me Corn</hi> (ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) <hi>I cannot live, unleſs I buy it:</hi>
               <note place="margin">De benef. l. 6. c. 14.</note> 
               <hi>but I owe not my life, becauſe I have bought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though <hi>de eventu</hi> ſuch acts of Juſtice may prove charitable, and ordinarily the buyer is advantaged thereby as well as the ſeller. The like I ſay, of lending upon U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury: it may be an act of Juſtice, though not of Charity: though <hi>intentionally</hi> it may be a charitable act, the lender deſigning his neighbours advantage, beſides his own: &amp; <hi>eventually</hi> alſo it may prove an act of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity or kindneſs, when the borrower comes off a gainer by the contract. And ſo it is really a kindneſs, where the lender takes but 2 or 3<hi>
                  <abbr>s</abbr>,</hi> where by the Law he might take 6<abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. But whatever this lending upon Uſe be, it is granted that lending freely is a greater kindneſs to the perſon receiving: yet the conſequence is lame, that if lending upon Uſe were a favour, they ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:107146:132"/>be injoined to lend upon Uſe to a <hi>Jew,</hi> for that free lending of the two, was a greater favour: giving is a greater fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour than ſelling; what then? muſt all ſelling be exploded to make room for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only? this would prove as abſurd in it ſelf, as it would be prejudicial to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of perſons and Nations.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Ainſwortb</hi> (quoted by Mr. <hi>Capel</hi>) ſaith, <hi>That to Strangers who were brethren in the faith, they might not lend upon <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury.</hi> Is this not rather againſt, than for him? would it not follow hence, that to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which were not of the Faith they might lend upon Uſury? and again it would admit of an inquiry, whether they might take Uſe of the <hi>Canaanite,</hi> or any of thoſe accurſed Nations when they were Proſelited, and become brethren in the Faith? If not, (as I think they dare not ſay it) upon the whole we ſhall find the caſe of all Strangers to be alike in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of Uſury.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>C.</hi> Starts an Objection,<note place="margin">p. 294.</note> 
               <hi>Is it not fit I ſhould have rent for my Money, as well as for my Land.</hi> The ſum of his anſwer is: <hi>When Money is lent to a poor man for bread, here it is acknowledged to be unlawful to take gain; but not ſo take Money for a piece of Arable Land, which this poor man rents at an indifferent rate, to provide bread for him and
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:107146:132"/>his; or to pay Money for an houſe he dwells in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply</hi> 1. If I am bound to help my poor neighbour; is it not all one, whether I give him twenty ſhillings out of my Purſe, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate him ſo much in the Rent of Houſe or Field he hires of me?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſe to a poor man one neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour lends twenty ſhillings; and a richer than he letts his Houſe to the ſame perſon: the former being bound to lend his Money freely to this poor man, may the other take his full Rent of him? I think, both the one, and the other, In caſe of extremity, are bound to ſhew charity to this poor man; as the one lending freely, ſo the other aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in his Rent; or elſe the burden would lie unequally on theſe two Mens Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let what follows ſerve for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this and the like Objections: that ſuch arguings are uſually guilty of a confuſion of Charity and Juſtice; They conſider what Charity requires on the Lenders part, and they obſerve and ſet againſt it what is juſt on the Setters part. It is juſt on the Setters part, ſay they, to require the Rent for the Houſe; It is juſt alſo, ſay I, on the lenders part, to take Uſe for his Money: but yet in this caſe before us, wherein the poor
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:107146:133"/>mans condition is conſidered, Juſtice muſt give place to Charity on both hands; the one for Charities ſake muſt lend his Money freely; the other for Charities ſake muſt deal favourably with him, ſetting his Houſe at a cheaper rate: and in ſome Caſes, the one muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to forgo his Rent, and the other to loſe his Principal.</p>

            <p>For a Cloſe to my Diſcourſe, I ſhall lay down a diſſwaſive from uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs in cenſuring Men for Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in Civil Contracts, farther than they have juſt ground for ſo doing. This diſſwaſive I ſhall ſtrengthen with a double ground.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe there is a certain Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in theſe Civil Contracts wherein Juſtice walks: the higheſt or loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of which latitude it were hard for any to charge with injuſtice. This is obſerved from <hi>Grotius</hi> out of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is moſt true</hi> (ſaith <hi>Grotius</hi>) <hi>what</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>hath written,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De Jure. l. 2. c. 8. §. 1.</note> 
               <hi>that a certitude cannot be found in Morals, equally as in Mathematical Sciences: which therefore happens, becauſe Mathematical Sciences ſeparate forms from all matter; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:107146:133"/>the forms themſelves for the most are ſuch, that they have no Medium; as there is not between right and crooked: But in Morals, the leaſt circumſtances change the matter and the forms whereby 'tis acted, have ſomewhat placed between them in that latitude, that approach is made ſometime nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to one, ſometime to another extream: for ſo between what ought to be done, and what ought not to be done; the middle is that which is lawful to be done; but nearer ſometime to one, ſometime to another extream: whence an ambiguity happens, as in the dawning of the day, or in cold water waxing hot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus then, what is right or lawful, in things of this nature, conſiſts not in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible point, ſo as that all that go near this ſide, or that do not run themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground on injuſtice, ſo long as they keep within the general bounds that Nature, Scripture, Reaſon and approved Cuſtoms have preſcribed to things of that nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As long as Intereſt is allowed by them as lawful, it is not eaſy to condemn ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of what they call Uſury; eſpecially when it enters not the bond, and the increaſe taken be moderate: for who can judge of another Mans concerns, ſo as perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to ſay, he hath ſuffered no prejudice by the loan, or that he might not have in the mean time improved the ſame money to his own advantage? Yea, and ſome
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:107146:134"/>Anti-Uſurers will allow of a Contract alſo for this increaſe, ſuppoſing the Principal be not ſufficiently ſecured, or any damage be probably foreſeen: in ſuch caſes, they ſay, it is not Uſury, but an honeſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the hazard that is run, or the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage probably foreſeen, or foregoing the opportunity of improving his Eſtate.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſay, on theſe accounts, if there were no other, there ſhould be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of raſh cenſuring: it becomes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to look to his Conſcience, in ſuch and the like Dealings and Contracts: that nothing be done to the prejudice of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Charity, Moderation, Equity and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but in all things to be careful to do to others, as in the like circumſtances they judge it reaſonable others ſhould do to them.</p>
